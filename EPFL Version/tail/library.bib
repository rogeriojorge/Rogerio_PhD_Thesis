abstract = {An analytic theory of the hydrodynamical structure of accreting disks (without self-gravitation but with pressure) orbiting around an axially symmetric, stationary, compact body (e.g., black hole) is presented. The inner edge of the marginally stable accreting disk (i.e., disk with constant angular momentum density) has a sharp cusp located on the equatorial plane no closer than the radius of the marginally bound circular orbit. The existence of the cusp is also typical for any angular momentum distribution. The physical importance of the cusp follows from the close analogy with the case of a close binary system (a Lagrange point on the Roche lobe). The existence of the cusp is thus a crucial phenomenon in such problems as boundary condition for the viscous stresses, accretion rate, etc.},

abstract = {Predictions of plasma parameters in the edge and scrape-off layer of tokamaks is difficult since most modern tokamaks have a divertor and the associated separatrix causes the usually employed field/flux-aligned coordinates to become singular on the separatrix/X-point. The presented field line map approach avoids such problems as it is based on a cylindrical grid: standard finite-difference methods can be used for the discretisation of perpendicular (w.r.t. magnetic field) operators, and the characteristic flute mode property (k) of structures is exploited computationally via a field line following discretisation of parallel operators which leads to grid sparsification in the toroidal direction. This paper is devoted to the discretisation of the parallel diffusion operator (the approach taken is very similar to the flux-coordinate independent (FCI) approach which has already been adopted to a hyperbolic problem (Ottaviani, 2011; Hariri, 2013)). Based on the support operator method, schemes are derived which maintain the self-adjointness property of the parallel diffusion operator on the discrete level. These methods have very low numerical perpendicular diffusion compared to a naive discretisation which is a critical issue since magnetically confined plasmas exhibit a very strong anisotropy. Two different versions of the discrete parallel diffusion operator are derived: the first is based on interpolation where the order of interpolation and therefore the numerical diffusion is adjustable; the second is based on integration and is advantageous in cases where the field line map is strongly distorted. The schemes are implemented in the new code GRILLIX, and extensive benchmarks and numerous examples are presented which show the validity of the approach in general and GRILLIX in particular.},

The dominant feature of edge turbulence is a high level of broadband density fluctuations with a relative amplitude $\delta$n/n ∼ 5–100{\%}, accompanied by large potential and electron temperature fluctuations. The frequency range of this turbulence is ∼10 kHz–1MHz, and the size scale is typically ∼0.1–10cm perpendicular to the magnetic field but many metres along the magnetic field, i.e. the structure is nearly that of 2D ‘filaments'. Large intermittent bursts or ‘blobs' are usually observed in the scrape-off layer. Diagnostic and data analysis techniques are reviewed and the main experimental results are summarized. Recent comparisons of experimental results with edge turbulence theory are discussed, and some directions for future experiments are suggested.},

abstract = {Short mean free path descriptions of magnetized plasmas have existed for almost 50 years so it is surprising to find that further modifications are necessary. The earliest work adopted an ordering in which the flow velocity is assumed to be comparable to the ion thermal speed. Later, less well-known studies extended the short mean free path treatment to the normally more interesting drift ordering in which the pressure times the mean flow velocity is comparable to the diamagnetic heat flow. Such an ordering is required to properly retain the temperature gradient terms in the viscosity that arise from the gyrophase dependent and independent portions of the distribution function. The treatment herein corrects the expressions for the parallel and perpendicular collisional ion viscosities found in these later treatments which use an approximate truncated polynomial expression for the distribution function and neglect the nonlinear piece of the collision operator due to its bilinear form.

@article{Parker1999,
abstract = {Two common computational domains used in gyrokinetic turbulence simulations are a local flux-tube and a global whole plasma volume. The effect of a radially varying pressure gradient is found to explain some of the qualitative differences between these two models. It is shown that a coherent purely radial mode is the result of profile variation. In addition, as profile variation is increased, there is a fairly sudden transition to much lower levels of heat flux. This may explain lower values found in past global simulations. The self-generated purely radial electrostatic potential is found to be 180 degrees out of phase with the flux-surface-averaged ion temperature. A theoretical relation between these two quantities is derived by relating the ExB nonlinearities for ion density and temperature for purely radial modes. This relation is used to explain the various radial mode shapes. Extending these results, a possible scheme is explored to reduce the heat flux by adding a ripple to the ion temperature profile. It may be possible to achieve similar results experimentally using ion cyclotron resonance heating. Finally, simulation results show the additional stabilizing effect of equilibrium E-r shear from profile variation in the radial force balance equation.

@article{LaBombard2004,
abstract = {Plasma profiles and flows in the low- and high-field side scrape-off-layer (SOL) regions in Alcator C-Mod are found to be remarkably sensitive to magnetic separatrix topologies (upper-, lower- and double-null) and to impose topology-dependent flow boundary conditions on the confined plasma. Near-sonic plasma flows along magnetic field lines are observed in the high-field SOL, with magnitude and direction clearly dependent on X-point location. The principal drive mechanism for the flows is a strong ballooning-like poloidal transport asymmetry: parallel flows arise so as to re-symmetrize the resulting poloidal pressure variation in the SOL. Secondary flows involving a combination of toroidal rotation and Pfirsch–Schl{\"{u}}ter ion currents are also evident. As a result of the transport-driven parallel flows, the SOL exhibits a net co-current (counter-current) volume-averaged toroidal momentum when B × ∇B is towards (away from) the X-point. Depending on the discharge conditions, flow momentum can couple across the separatrix and affect the toroidal rotation of the confined plasma. This mechanism accounts for a positive (negative) increment in central plasma co-rotation seen in L-mode discharges when B × ∇B is towards (away from) the X-point. Experiments in ion-cyclotron range-of-frequency-heated discharges suggest that topology-dependent flow boundary conditions may also play a role in the sensitivity of the L–H power threshold to X-point location: in a set of otherwise similar discharges, the L–H transition is seen to be coincident with central rotation achieving roughly the same value, independent of magnetic topology. For discharges with B × ∇B pointing away from the X-point (i.e. with the SOL flow boundary condition impeding co-current rotation), the same characteristic rotation can only be achieved with higher input power.},

Plasmas 19, 072102 (2012) Drift wave dispersion relation for arbitrarily collisional plasma Using the quantum hydrodynamic model of plasmas and with quantum effects arising through the Bohm potential and the Fermi degenerate pressure, the possible drift waves and their instabilities have been investigated in considerable detail in a nonuniform dusty magnetoplasma. It is found that in the presence of a nonuniform ambient magnetic field, the drift waves grow in amplitude by taking energy from the streaming ions and density inhomogeneity. The implication of the drift wave instability for nonthermal electrostatic fluctuations to laboratory and astrophysical environments is also pointed out. In recent years, there has been a growing enthusiasm in quantum plasmas because of their importance in microelec-tronics and electronic devices with nanoelectronic components, 1,2 dense astrophysical systems, 3–5 and in laser-produced plasmas. 6–9 When a plasma is cooled to an ex-tremely low temperature, the de Broglie wavelengths of the plasma particles could be at least comparable to the scale lengths, such as Debye length or Larmor radius, in the sys-tem. In such plasmas, the ultracold dense plasma would be-have as a Fermi gas and quantum mechanical effects might play a vital role in the behavior of the charge carriers of these plasmas under extreme conditions. We can visualize that the density and static ambient magnetic field in a quantum dusty magnetoplasma can be nonuniform with finite scale lengths. The density inhomoge-neity causes the presence of drift waves due to diamagnetic drifts, and the magnetic field inhomogeneity causes a uni-form stream of ions. In this Brief Communication, we study the possible drift waves and their instabilities due to the free energy sources of density nonuniformity and a uniform beam of ions due to the ambient magnetic field gradient. We consider an infinitely extended inhomogeneous high density dusty magnetoplasma containing electrons, ions, and charged dust grains in the presence of an inhomogeneous static ambient magnetic field B 0 ͑x͒ ʈ .

In addition the physics of plasma rotation has been implemented through a formulation of the gyro-kinetic equation in the co-moving system. The gyro-kinetic model is five-dimensional and requires a massive parallel approach. GKW has been parallelised using MPI and scales well up to 8192+ cores.

abstract = {First-principles simulations of tokamak turbulence have proven to be of great value in recent decades. We develop a pseudo-spectral velocity formulation of the turbulence equations that smoothly interpolates between the highly efficient but lower resolution three-dimensional (3-D) gyrofluid representation and the conventional but more expensive 5-D gyrokinetic representation. Our formulation is a projection of the nonlinear gyrokinetic equation onto a Laguerre–Hermite velocity-space basis. We discuss issues related to collisions, closures and entropy. While any collision operator can be used in the formulation, we highlight a model operator that has a particularly sparse Laguerre–Hermite representation, while satisfying conservation laws and the H theorem. Free streaming, magnetic drifts and nonlinear phase mixing each give rise to closure problems, which we discuss in relation to the instabilities of interest and to free energy conservation. We show that the model is capable of reproducing gyrokinetic results for linear instabilities and zonal flow dynamics. Thus the final model is appropriate for the study of instabilities, turbulence and transport in a wide range of geometries, including tokamaks and stellarators.},

While mechanisms exist to generate these in the late universe, it is possible that magnetic fields have existed since very early times. This thesis is concerned with methods to predict the form of such imprints. We review in detail a standard, linearised cosmology before introducing an electromagnetic field. We then consider the intrinsic statistics of the magnetic stresses in two ways, analytically and via static realisations. We construct the power spectra, some of which we present for the first time. At the one- and three-point level we find significant intrinsic non-Gaussianities. Finally we turn to the observable impacts a primordial magnetic field. Assuming coherence, the statistics of the source can be mapped onto the CMB in a simple manner. We demonstrate that our approach is valid by reproducing the signals for Gaussian power law fields on the microwave sky. [ABRIDGED]},

Its structure is designed for maximum flexibility regarding the choice of coordinate system and dielectric model. The versatility of this code makes it particularly suitable for integrated modeling systems. Using a coordinate system that reflects the nested structure of magnetic flux surfaces in tokamaks, fast and accurate calculations inside the plasma separatrix can be performed using analytical derivatives of a spline-Fourier interpolation of the axisymmetric toroidal MHD equilibrium. Applications to reverse field pinch magnetic configuration are also included. The effects of 3D perturbations of the axisymmetric toroidal MHD equilibrium, due to the discreteness of the magnetic coil system or plasma fluctuations in an original quasi-optical approach, are also studied. Using a Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg method for solving the set of ordinary differential equations, the ray-tracing code is extensively benchmarked against analytical models and other codes for lower hybrid and electron cyclotron waves.

While all previous results in the subject were limited to the spatially homogeneous case, here we manage to cover the general, space-dependent situation, assuming only basic physical estimates of finite mass, energy, entropy and entropy production. The proofs are based on the recent results and methods introduced previously in [R. Alexandre, C. Villani, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 55 (1) (2002) 30-70] by both authors, and the entropy production smoothing effects established in [R. Alexandre et al., Arch. Rational Mech. Anal. 152 (4) (2000) 327-355]. We are able to treat realistic singularities of Coulomb type, and approximations of the Debye cut. However, our method only works for finite-time intervals, while the Landau equation is supposed to describe long-time corrections to the Vlasov-Poisson equation. If the mean-field interaction is neglected, then our results apply to physically relevant situations after a time rescaling. ?? 2003 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

It is shown that the electromagnetic effects on primarily electrostatic microinstabilities are generally weakly or moderately stabilizing. However, the saturation of these modes and hence the determination of the transport level in the quasi-stationary turbulent state can be dominated by nonlinear electromagnetic effects and yield surprising results. Despite this, the induced transport is generally electrostatic in nature well below the ideal ballooning limit.},

abstract = {Guiding-center theory provides the reduced dynamical equations for the motion of charged particles in slowly varying electromagnetic fields, when the fields have weak variations over a gyration radius (or gyroradius) in space and a gyration period (or gyroperiod) in time. Canonical and noncanonical Hamiltonian formulations of guiding-center motion offer improvements over non-Hamiltonian formulations: Hamiltonian formulations possess Noether's theorem (hence invariants follow from symmetries), and they preserve the Poincar{\'{e}} invariants (so that spurious attractors are prevented from appearing in simulations of guiding-center dynamics). Hamiltonian guiding-center theory is guaranteed to have an energy conservation law for time-independent fields—something that is not true of non-Hamiltonian guiding-center theories. The use of the phase-space Lagrangian approach facilitates this development, as there is no need to transform a priori to canonical coordinates, such as flux coordinates, which have less physical meaning. The theory of Hamiltonian dynamics is reviewed, and is used to derive the noncanonical Hamiltonian theory of guiding-center motion. This theory is further explored within the context of magnetic flux coordinates, including the generic form along with those applicable to systems in which the magnetic fields lie on nested tori. It is shown how to return to canonical coordinates to arbitrary accuracy by the Hazeltine-Meiss method and by a perturbation theory applied to the phase-space Lagrangian. This noncanonical Hamiltonian theory is used to derive the higher-order corrections to the magnetic moment adiabatic invariant and to compute the longitudinal adiabatic invariant. Noncanonical guiding-center theory is also developed for relativistic dynamics, where covariant and noncovariant results are presented. The latter is important for computations in which it is convenient to use the ordinary time as the independent variable rather than the proper time. The final section uses noncanonical guiding-center theory to discuss the dynamics of particles in systems in which the magnetic-field lines lie on nested toroidal flux surfaces. A hierarchy in the extent to which particles move off of flux surfaces is established. This hierarchy extends from no motion off flux surfaces for any particle to no average motion off flux surfaces for particular types of particles. Future work in magnetically confined plasmas may make use of this hierarchy in designing systems that minimize transport losses.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd. The GRILLIX code is presented with which plasma turbulence/transport in various geometries can be simulated in 3D.

Phys. Commun. 198 139). Cylindrical or Cartesian grids are used on which perpendicular operators are discretised via standard finite difference methods and parallel operators via a field line tracing and interpolation procedure (field line map). This offers a very high flexibility with respect to geometry, especially a separatrix with X-point(s) or a magnetic axis can be treated easily in contrast to approaches which are based on field aligned coordinates and suffer from coordinate singularities. Aiming finally for simulation of edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) turbulence, an isothermal electrostatic drift-reduced Braginskii model (Zeiler et al 1997 Phys. Plasmas 4 2134) has been implemented in GRILLIX. We present the numerical approach, which is based on a toroidally staggered formulation of the FCI, we show verification of the code with the method of manufactured solutions and show a benchmark based on a TORPEX blob experiment, previously performed by several edge/SOL codes (Riva et al 2016 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 58 044005). Examples for slab, circular, limiter and diverted geometry are presented.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd. We perform a thorough study of greybody factors for minimally-coupled scalar fields propagating on the background of rotating black holes (BHs) in higher (odd) dimensions with all angular momenta set equal. For this special case, the solution enjoys an enhanced symmetry, which translates into the advantageous feature of being cohomogeneity-1, i.e., these backgrounds depend on a single radial coordinate. Our analysis contemplates three distinct situations, with the cosmological constant being zero, positive or negative. Using the technique of matched asymptotic expansions we analytically compute the greybody factors in the low-frequency regime, restricting to s-wave scattering. Our formulas generalize those obtained previously in the literature for the static and spherically symmetric case, with corrections arising from the change in the horizon area due to rotation. It is also proven that, for this family of BHs, the horizon area is a decreasing function of the spin parameter, without regard to the dimensionality and cosmological constant. Through an improvement on a calculation specific to the class of small BHs in anti-de Sitter (AdS) and not restricted to the usual low-frequency regime, we uncover a rich structure of the greybody spectrum, more complex than previously reported but also enjoying a certain degree of universality. We complement our low-frequency analytic results with numerical computations valid over a wide range of frequencies and extend them to higher angular momentum quantum numbers, ℓ {\textgreater} 0. This allows us to probe the superradiant regime that is observed for corotating wavefunctions. We point out that the maximum amplification factor for intermediate-size BHs in AdS can be surprisingly large.},

abstract = {Better forecasting energy demand in China and India can help those countries meet future challenges caused by the changes in that demand, as well as inform future global energy needs. In this study, the single-linear, hybrid-linear, and non-linear forecasting techniques based on grey theory are developed to more accurately forecasting energy demand in China and India. These prosed techniques were applied to simulate China's and India's energy consumption of China and India between 1990 and 2016. Three standards (trend map, error measure, and fit method) of analyzing quality of forecast technique are used to quantify the quality of these proposed technique. The results show these proposed techniques have a very high degree of fit, a low error rate, and high fitting precision. For example, the mean absolute percent error of single-linear, hybrid-linear, and non-linear techniques are 1.30–3.08{\%}, 0.80–2.57{\%}, and 2.06–2.19{\%}, respectively. The results of optimality analysis show these proposed models can produce reliable forecasting results in China and India, which might be used to forecasting energy demand in other countries/regions. Our forecasting results show the annual growth rate of India's energy demand from 2017 to 2026 will be 4.49{\%}–5.21{\%} (single-linear), 2.42{\%}–7.04{\%} (hybrid-linear), 0.58{\%}–4.02{\%} (non-linear), respectively. The annual growth rate of China's energy demand from 2017 to 2026 will be 1.36{\%}–1.70{\%} (single-linear), 1.04{\%}–1.49{\%} (hybrid-linear), 1.80{\%}–2.34{\%} (non-linear), respectively. The growth rate of India's energy consumption is expected to be 2–4 times that of China from 2017 to 2026, indicating India will become even more important in the global energy market.},

@article{Kulsrud1997,
abstract = {It is demonstrated that strong magnetic fields are produced from a zero initial magnetic field during the pregalactic era, when the galaxy is first forming. Their development proceeds in three phases. In the first phase, weak magnetic fields are created by the Biermann battery mechanism. During the second phase, results from a numerical simulation make it appear likely that homogenous isotropic Kolmogorov turbulence develops that is associated with gravitational structure formation of galaxies. Assuming that this turbulence is real, then these weak magnetic fields will be amplified to strong magnetic fields by this Kolmogorov turbulence. During this second phase, the magnetic fields reach saturation with the turbulent power, but they are coherent only on the scale of the smallest eddy. During the third phase, which follows this saturation, it is expected that the magnetic field strength will increase to equipartition with the turbulent energy and that the coherence length of the magnetic fields will increase to the scale of the largest turbulent eddy, comparable to the scale of the entire galaxy. The resulting magnetic field represents a galactic magnetic field of primordial origin. No further dynamo action after the galaxy forms is necessary to explain the origin of magnetic fields. However, the magnetic field will certainly be altered by dynamo action once the galaxy and the galactic disk have formed. It is first shown by direct numerical simulations that thermoelectric currents associated with the Biermann battery build the field up from zero to 10-21 G in the regions about to collapse into galaxies, by z {\~{}} 3. For weak fields, in the absence of dissipation, the cyclotron frequency -$\omega$cyc = eB{\$}{\{}{\&}bmi; B{\}}{\$} --{\textgreater}/mH c and $\omega$/(1 + $\chi$), where ∇ × v{\$}{\{}{\&}bmi; v{\}}{\$} --{\textgreater} is the vorticity and $\chi$ is the degree of ionization, satisfy the same equations, and initial conditions $\omega$cyc = $\omega$ = 0, so that, globally, -$\omega$cyc(r{\$}{\{}{\&}bmi; r{\}}{\$} --{\textgreater}, t) = $\omega$(r{\$}{\{}{\&}bmi; r{\}}{\$} --{\textgreater}, t)/(1 + $\chi$). The vorticity grows rapidly after caustics (extreme nonlinearities) develop in the cosmic fluid. At this time, it is made plausible that turbulence has developed into Kolmogorov turbulence. Numerical simulations do not yet have the resolution to demonstrate that, during the second phase, the magnetic fields are amplified by the dynamo action of the turbulence. Instead, an analytic theory of the turbulent amplification of magnetic fields is employed to explore this phase of the magnetic field development. From this theory, it is shown that, assuming the turbulence is really Kolmogorov turbulence, the dynamo action of this protogalactic turbulence is able to amplify the magnetic fields by such a large factor during the collapse of the protogalaxy that the power into the magnetic field must reach saturation with the turbulent power. For the third phase, there is as yet no analytic theory capable of describing this phase. However, preliminary turbulence calculations currently in progress seem to confirm that the magnetic fields may proceed to equipartition with the turbulent energy, and that the coherence length may increase to the largest scales. Simple physical arguments are presented that show that this may be the case. Such an equipartition field is actually too strong to allow immediate collapse to a disk. Possible ways around this difficulty are discussed.},

However, if the 2D convective rate of blobs is on the order of the growth rate of unstable drift waves, then drift wave turbulence can drastically alter the dynamics of blobs from that predicted by 2D theory. The density gradients in the drift plane that characterize the blob are mostly depleted during the nonlinear stage of drift waves resulting in a much more diffuse blob with a greatly reduced radial velocity. Sheath connected plasma blobs driven by effective gravity forces are considered in this Letter and it is found that the effects of resistive drift waves occur at earlier stages in the 2D motion for smaller blobs and in systems with a smaller effective gravity force. These conclusions are supported numerically by a direct comparison of 2D and 3D seeded blob simulations.},

In this generalized Lagrangian formulation, the energy conservation property for the total nonlinear gyrokinetic system of equations is directly shown from Noether's theorem. This formulation can be utilized in order to derive the nonlinear gyrokinetic system of equations and the rigorously conserved total energy for fluctuations with arbitrary frequencies.

abstract = {The ability to exhaust the plasma power loss from a large tokamak onto material walls surrounding the plasma has been perceived to be a large obstacle to the successful production of a fusion power reactor in the past. There have been tremendous strides in understanding the physics relevant to this power exhaust over the past five years. This improvement in understanding has arisen because of both improved diagnostics of the plasma outside the last closed flux surface, and because of improved two dimensional computer models of this plasma. This understanding has led to innovative plasma solutions that reduce the power load to the divertor region of ITER to levels that are acceptable for a successful engineering design of the divertors. These plasma solutions have been realized in the devices that are active today. Analysis using the improved plasma models also indicates that particle control, both of fuel and impurity particles, is adequate for successful operation of ITER. This paper presents the current status of both the experimental and theoretical understanding of the plasma, neutral and atomic physics relevant to the plasma at the edge of fusion devices. Since understanding of the subject of this paper is progressing rapidly, we should emphasize that this paper was written in the spring of 1998 and, as such, presents the status of the subject at that time.},

abstract = {The two-dimensional fluid turbulence code SOLT is employed to study the role of midplane turbulence on the scrape-off-layer (SOL) heat flux width of tokamak plasmas. The physics simulated includes curvature-driven-interchange modes, sheath losses, and perpendicular turbulent diffusive and convective (blob) transport. Midplane SOL profiles of density, temperature and parallel heat flux are obtained from the simulation and compared with experimental results from the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) to study the scaling of the heat flux width with power and plasma current. It is concluded that midplane turbulence is the main contributor to the SOL width for the low power ELM-free H-mode discharges studied, while additional physics is required to explain the plasma current scaling of the SOL width observed experimentally in higher power discharges. Additional simulations predict a transition to a convectively-dominated SOL at critical values of power and connection length. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Continuous control over azimuthal flow and shear in the edge of the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) has been achieved using a biasable limiter which has allowed a careful study of the effect of flow shear on pressure-gradient-driven turbulence and transport in the LAPD. The LAPD rotates spontaneously in the ion diamagnetic direction; positive limiter bias first reduces, then minimizes (producing a near-zero shear state), and finally reverses the flow into the electron diamagnetic direction. Degradation of particle confinement is observed in the minimum shearing state and a reduction in the turbulent particle flux is observed with increasing shearing in both flow directions. Near-complete suppression of the turbulent particle flux is observed for shearing rates comparable to the turbulent autocorrelation rate measured in the minimum shear state. Turbulent flux suppression is dominated by amplitude reduction in low-frequency ({\textless} 10 kHz) density fluctuations. An increase in fluctuations for the highest shearing states is observed with the emergence of a coherent mode which does not lead to net particle transport. The variations of density fluctuations are fit well with power laws and compare favorably to simple models of shear suppression of transport. While flow shear does provide a source of free energy for instability and turbulence, it can lead to stabilization of pressure-gradient-driven instabilities and a reduction of turbulent transport in magnetized plasmas [1,2]. The trans-port barrier in the high-confinement mode, or H-mode, of tokamak operation [3], is attributed to the spontaneous development of an edge flow layer in which strong shear-ing suppresses transport [1,2]. The direct connection be-tween the H-mode edge flow layer and improved confinement was first established in experiments on the Continuous Current Tokamak in which transport barriers were generated by directly driving edge flow using torque due to radial currents driven by biased electrodes [4]. Biasing has been used to produce improved confinement in a number of subsequent experiments including toroidal devices [5–8] and linear magnetized plasmas [9–11]. Turbulence can self-regulate through the generation of flows and flow shear (zonal flows) [2]; direct evidence for turbulent-Reynolds-stress-driven flow has been re-ported in a cylindrical magnetized plasma device [12]. While ample evidence for transport reduction in the presence of sheared flow exists [13,14] and significant effort and progress has been made in developing a theo-retical understanding of the interaction between sheared flow and turbulence, there are still a number of open questions that can be answered by experiment. In particu-lar, the exact mechanism behind turbulence modification and transport suppression by shear is still subject to debate: theories present a number of mechanisms including radial decorrelation [15], nonlinear reduction of the turbulent amplitude [16], and modification of the turbulent cross-phase [17]. Evidence for all of these mechanisms exists in experimental data [6,14]; however, a comprehensive ex-perimental data set establishing in detail the parameter regimes where each mechanism is important has not been acquired. In part, this is due to the fact that most data sets on flow-turbulence interaction come from studies of spon-taneously generated flow or in cases where precise external control over flow and flow shear is not possible. A number of basic plasma experiments have utilized biasing tech-niques to control flow and flow shear to study flow driven instabilities (e.g., Refs. [18,19]); however, experiments have not been done in which precise external control over flow shear has been achieved in high-density plasmas with drift-wave turbulence to systematically study the changes in turbulence characteristics and transport. In this Letter, we report on the first experiments in which external control of flow is used to document the response of turbulence and transport to a continuous variation of the flow shear, including a zero shear state and a reversal of the flow direction. Shearing rates (s ¼ @V =@r, where V ¼ E r =B) from zero to up to five times the turbulent autocor-relation rate measured at zero flow shear (},

abstract = {The current understanding of astrophysical magnetic fields is reviewed, focusing on their generation and maintenance by turbulence. In the astrophysical context this generation is usually explained by a self-excited dynamo, which involves flows that can amplify a weak 'seed' magnetic field exponentially fast. Particular emphasis is placed on the nonlinear saturation of the dynamo. Analytic and numerical results are discussed both for small scale dynamos, which are completely isotropic, and for large scale dynamos, where some form of parity breaking is crucial. Central to the discussion of large scale dynamos is the so-called alpha effect which explains the generation of a mean field if the turbulence lacks mirror symmetry, i.e. if the flow has kinetic helicity. Large scale dynamos produce small scale helical fields as a waste product that quench the large scale dynamo and hence the alpha seffect. With this in mind, the microscopic theory of the alpha effect is revisited in full detail and recent results for the loss of helical magnetic fields are reviewed. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The present simulation on the zonal flow and the geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) successfully reproduces the neoclassical polarization of trapped ions as well as the parallel phase mixing due to passing particles. During the collisionless damping of GAM, finer-scale structures of the ion distribution function in the velocity space continue to develop due to the phase mixing while preserving an invariant defined by a sum of an entropy variable and the potential energy. Simulation results of the the toroidal ITG turbulent transport clearly show generation of the fine velocity-space structures of the distribution function and their collisional dissipation. Detailed calculation of the entropy balance confirms the statistically steady state of turbulence, where the anomalous transport balances with the dissipation given by the weak collisionality. The above results obtained by simulations with high velocity-space resolution are understood in terms of generation, transfer, and dissipation processes of the entropy variable in the phase space.},

Moreover, at fixed values of normalized collisionality parameter (characterized as the 'diamagnetic parameter', $\alpha$ d ), electron pressure gradients in the near SOL increase with plasma current squared, holding the MHD ballooning parameter, $\alpha$ MHD , unchanged. Thus, the state of the near SOL is restricted to a narrow region within this two-parameter phase-space. An implication is that cross-field heat and particle transport are strong functions of these parameters. Indeed, as $\alpha$ d is decreased below {\~{}}0.3, cross-field heat convection increases sharply and competes with parallel heat conduction along open field lines, making high plasma density regions of $\alpha$ MHD –$\alpha$ d space energetically inaccessible. These observations are consistent with the idea that the operational space of the edge plasma, including boundaries associated with the tokamak density limit, is controlled by EMFDT.},

The initial simulation results show that a bipolar jet (velocity {\~{}}0.3c) is created, as shown by previous two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations with mirror symmetry at the equator. The three-dimensional simulation ran over 100 light crossing time units (tauS=rS/c, where rS≡2GM/c2), which is considerably longer than the previous simulations. We show that the jet is initially formed as predicted owing in part to magnetic pressure from the twisting of the initially uniform magnetic field and from gas pressure associated with shock formation in the region around r=3rS. At later times, the accretion disk becomes thick and the jet fades resulting in a wind that is ejected from the surface of the thickened (torus-like) disk. It should be noted that no streaming matter from a donor is included at the outer boundary in the simulation (an isolated black hole not binary black hole). The wind flows outward with a wider angle than the initial jet. The widening of the jet is consistent with the outward-moving torsional Alfv{\{}{\'{e}}{\}}n waves. This evolution of disk-jet coupling suggests that the jet fades with a thickened accretion disk because of the lack of streaming material from an accompanying star.},

Three linear modes of potential importance are found: the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, the tertiary mode, and a nonlocal drift wave instability. Each mode is unstable only in the presence of nontrivial spatial variations in either the E×B flow andor the plasma gradients. The strongest conclusion of this study is that the drift wave mode may be an important driver of anomalous transport in the edge region of magnetic confinement devices. Two other weaker conclusions that warrant further study are as follows: (1) the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability may be associated with edge-localized modes or edge transport and (2) the tertiary mode can potentially limit the radial growth of a transport barrier. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

When the closure model is applied to the three-mode ion temperature gradient (ITG) driven system, the fluid system of equations reproduces the exact nonlinear kinetic solution found by Watanabe, Sugama, and Sato [Phys. Plasmas 7, 984 (2000)]. Oscillatory behaviors and initial amplitude dependence of other numerical kinetic solutions of the three-mode ITG problem can also be accurately described by the fluid system. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Incorporation of kinetic effects such as Landau damping into a fluid framework was pioneered by Hammett and Perkins, by obtaining closures of the fluid hierarchy, where the gyrotropic heat flux fluctuations or the deviation of the fourth-order gyrotropic fluid moment are expressed through lower-order fluid moments. To obtain a closure of a fluid model expanded around a bi-Maxwellian distribution function, the usual plasma dispersion function Z ( $\zeta$ ) that appears in kinetic theory or the associated plasma response function R ( $\zeta$ ) = 1 + $\zeta$ Z ( $\zeta$ ) has to be approximated with a suitable Pad{\'{e}} approximant in such a way that the closure is valid for all $\zeta$ values. Such closures are rare, and the original closures of Hammett and Perkins are often employed. Here we present a complete mapping of all plausible Landau fluid closures that can be constructed at the level of fourth-order moments in the gyrotropic limit and we identify the most precise closures. Furthermore, by considering 1D closures at higher-order moments, we show that it is possible to reproduce linear Landau damping in the fluid framework to any desired precision, thus showing convergence of the fluid and collisionless kinetic descriptions.},

abstract = {The short mean-free path expansion used in fluid modeling of scrape-off layer plasmas is often violated for typical discharge parameters, especially by the superthermal particles, which carry most of the heat flux. Thus, the tail of the distribution function can strongly depart from Maxwellian due to nonlocal mean-free path effects, which can modify plasmatransport, impurity radiation, and plasma–neutral gas interactions. These nonlocal effects become particularly pronounced for detached plasma conditions that are characterized by sharp gradients in the plasma parameters along the magnetic field. These problems are being addressed by developing one spatial dimension and two velocity variables, fully kinetic, collisional, and time-dependent particle-in-cell code, W1 [Contrib. Plasma Phys. 34, 436 (1994)], and its parallel-computer version, PW1 [Contrib. Plasma Phys. 34, 424 (1996)]. Comparisons are made with the Fokker–Planck code ALLA [Phys.

Kinetic effects on probe measurement interpretation, impurity radiation, and parallel heat conductivity due to non-Maxwellian features in scrape-off layer plasmas are considered.

abstract = {TURBULENCE AND TRANSPORT in toroidal plasmas is studied via the development of an electromagnetic gyrofluid model, and its imple- mentation in realistic nonlinear simulations. This work extends ear- lier electrostatic gyrofluid models to include magnetic fluctuations and non-adiabatic passing electron dynamics. A new set of electron fluid equations is derived from the drift kinetic equation, via an expansion in the electron-ion mass ratio. These electron equations include descriptions of linear and nonlinear drift motion, Landau damping, and electron-ion collisions. Ion moment equations are de- rived from the electromagnetic gyrokinetic equation, and the gyrokinetic Poisson's Equation and Ampere's Law close the system. The model is benchmarked with linear gyrokinetic calculations, and good agreement is found for both the finite-$\beta$ ion temperature gradient (ITG) and kinetic Alfv´ en ballooning (KBM) instabilities. Nonlinear simulations of ITG and KBM-driven turbulence are performed in toroidal flux tube geometry at a range of values of plasma $\beta$, and electromagnetic effects are found to significantly impact turbulent heat and particle transport. At low values of $\beta$, transport is reduced, as expected due to the finite-$\beta$ stabilization of the ITG mode. However, as $\beta$ approaches the ideal-MHD stability threshold, transport can increase. In the presence of dissipation provided by a model of electron Landau damping and electron-ion collisions, this transport increase can be quite dramatic. Finally, the results of the simulations are compared to tokamak experiments, and encouraging agreement is found with measured density and temperature fluctua- tion spectra. Direct comparisons of transport fluxes reveal that electromagnetic effects are important at characteristic edge parameters, bringing predicted fluxes more closely in line with observations.},

The explicit calculation of Rosenbluth potentials converts the integro-differential form of the Coulomb collision operator into a differential operator, which enables one to express the collision operator in a simple closed form for any arbitrary mass and temperature ratios. In addition, it is shown that gyrophase averaging the collision operator acting on arbitrary distribution functions is the same as the collision operator acting on the corresponding gyrophase averaged distribution functions. The moments of the collision operator are linear combinations of the fluid moments with collision coefficients parametrized by mass and temperature ratios.

Our numerical study is based on a four field full-F gyrofluid model, which entails the consistent description of high fluctuation amplitudes and dynamic finite Larmor radius effects. We find that an initial electron or ion temperature perturbation increases the maximal radial blob velocity and that a finite Larmor radius contributes to highly compact blob structures that propagate in the poloidal direction. An extensive parameter study reveals that a smooth transition to this compact blob regime occurs when the finite Larmor radius effect strength, defined by the ratio of the ion diamagnetic to the perpendicular vorticity, exceeds unity. The maximal radial blob velocities agree excellently with the inertial velocity scaling law over more than an order of magnitude. We show that the finite Larmor radius effect strength affects the poloidal and total particle transport and present an empirical scaling law for the poloidal and total blob velocities. Distinctions to the blob behaviour in the isothermal limit with constant finite Larmor radius effects are highlighted.},

We suggest that the distinct behaviour of the particle confinement for positive and negative bias observed in ISTTOK is related to the low E × B shear induced by positive bias in the core periphery region associated with the appearance of large amplitude fluctuations. In addition, the effect of the electrode bias on the edge turbulent transport has been investigated identifying the changes induced in the fluctuations frequency spectrum and probability density function. We have shown that negative electrode bias reduces the propagation of large-scale events, making the fluctuations distribution more Gaussian and resulting in low amplitude fluctuations across most of the edge plasma region. For positive bias, large amplitude broad spectrum fluctuations appear in the core periphery, which increase the cross-field diffusion and contribute to the observed asymmetry in particle transport with the bias polarity.},

abstract = {Nonlinear, kinetic simulations of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) under laser-fusion conditions present a bursting behavior. Different explanations for this regime have been given in previous studies: saturation of SRS by increased nonlinear Landau damping [K. Estabrook et al., Phys. Fluids B 1, 1282 (1989)], and detuning due to the nonlinear frequency shift of the plasma wave [H. X. Vu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 4306 (2001)]. Another mechanism, also assigning a key role to the trapped electrons is proposed here: the breakup of the plasma wave through the trapped-particle instability. A more thorough understanding of the dynamics of parametric instabilities is essential in order to improve the existing tools used for designing laser-fusion systems [1]. Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) are the basic two such insta-bilities affecting the laser beam, respectively, involving the scattering off of ion-acoustic waves (IAWs) and elec-tron plasma waves (EPWs). In the following, we shall essentially address issues involving the nonlinear evolu-tion of SRS. The bursting behavior of SRS appears as a common characteristic of different nonlinear, kinetic simulations [2,3]: Instead of reaching a steady state, with constant intensity of the reflected light, SRS presents an ongoing dynamical evolution, building up and breaking down in cycles. In these previous studies, different mechanisms have been suggested for this intermittence. The nonlinear wave-particle interaction has, however, always been iden-tified as playing a key role: Estabrook, Kruer, and Haines [2] tentatively propose that SRS saturates as a result of increased nonlinear Landau damping, due to hot elec-trons generated through the trapping process, while Vu, DuBois, and Bezzerides [3] more recently interpreted their results by proposing that trapped particles lead to a significant nonlinear shift in the EPW frequency, which then detunes the parametric instability. On the basis of new simulations, a third possible mechanism for explain-ing the pulsating of SRS is presented in this Letter, also assigning an essential role to trapped electrons: The breakup of the EPW through a secondary instability, the so-called trapped-particle instability (TPI), first de-scribed by Kruer, Dawson, and Sudan [4,5]. The results are based on a spatially one-dimensional model with open boundaries, which represents the laser-plasma interaction along the beam. The Vlasov equation for both electrons and ions is solved numerically in the phase space x; v x  —x and v x are, respectively, the posi-tion and velocity along the laser beam—by applying an Eulerian scheme [6], which evolves the particle distribu-tions on a fixed Cartesian mesh in phase space. In this way, the essential kinetic effect, i.e., the nonlinear trap-ping of particles by the longitudinal waves in the plasma (EPWs and IAWs), is taken into account. The transverse motion is described in the cold fluid approximation. The physical parameters are inspired by conditions relevant to the National Ignition Facility [1]. The initial electron and ion temperatures are thus chosen T e  1:5 and T i  0:1 keV, and the density is assumed to be 10{\%} of the critical density at the considered laser wavelength in vacuum},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {A minimal model for magnetic reconnection and, generally, low-frequency dynamics in low-beta plasmas is proposed. The model combines analytical and computational simplicity with physical realizability: it is a rigorous limit of gyrokinetics for plasma beta of order the electron-ion mass ratio. The model contains collisions and can be used both in the collisional and collisionless reconnection regimes. It includes gyrokinetic ions (not assumed cold) and allows for the topological rearrangement of the magnetic field lines by either resistivity or electron inertia, whichever predominates. The two-fluid dynamics are coupled to electron kinetics—electrons are not assumed isothermal and are described by a reduced drift-kinetic equation. The model, therefore allows for irreversibility and conversion of magnetic energy into electron heat via parallel phase mixing in velocity space. An analysis of the exchanges between various forms of free energy and its conversion into electron heat is provided. It is shown how all relevant linear waves and regimes of the tearing instability (collisionless, semicollisional, and fully resistive) are recovered in various limits of our model. An efficient way to simulate our equations numerically is proposed, via the Hermite representation of the velocity space. It is shown that small scales in velocity space will form, giving rise to a shallow Hermite-space spectrum, whence it is inferred that, for steady-state or sufficiently slow dynamics, the electron heating rate will remain finite in the limit of vanishing collisionality.},

A particular feature is the use of straight-field-line magnetic coordinates and a field-aligned Fourier filtering technique that dramatically improves the performance of the code in terms of both the numerical noise reduction and the maximum time step allowed. Another feature is the capability to treat arbitrary axisymmetric ideal MHD equilibrium configurations. The code is heavily parallelized, with scalability demonstrated up to 4096 processors and 109marker particles. Various numerical convergence tests are performed.

Current modelling efforts suffer either from a lack of kinetic physics, or an excess of computational complexity. To ameliorate these problems, we take a first-principles multiscale approach to the pedestal. We will present three separate sets of equations, covering the dynamics of Edge Lo- calised Modes, the inter-ELM pedestal, and pedestal turbulence, respectively. Precisely how these equations should be coupled to each other are covered in detail. This framework is completely self-consistent; it is derived from first principles by means an asymptotic expansion in appropriate small parameters. The derivation exploits the narrowness of the pedestal region, the smallness of the thermal gyroradius, and the low plasma {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} typical of current pedestal operation to achieve its simplifications. The relationship between this framework and gyrokinetics is analysed, and possibilities to directly match this framework onto multiscale gyrokinetics are explored. A detailed comparison between our model and other models in the literature is performed. Finally, the potential for matching this framework onto an open-field-line region is discussed.},

abstract = {Magnetic confinement fusion reactors suffer severely from heat and particle losses through turbulent transport, which has inspired the construction of ever larger and more expensive reactors. Numerical simulations are vital to their design and operation, but particle collisions are too infrequent for fluid descriptions to be valid. Instead, strongly magnetised fusion plasmas are described by the gyrokinetic equations, a nonlinear integro-differential system for evolving the particle distribution functions in a five-dimensional position and velocity space, and the consequent electromagnetic field. Due to the high dimensionality, simulations of small reactor sections require hundreds of thousands of CPU hours on High Performance Computing platforms. We develop a Hankel-Hermite spectral representation for velocity space that exploits structural features of the gyrokinetic system. The representation exactly conserves discrete free energy in the absence of explicit dissipation, while our Hermite hypercollision operator captures Landau damping with few variables. Calculation of the electromagnetic fields becomes purely local, eliminating inter-processor communication in, and vastly accelerating, searches for linear instabilities. We implement these ideas in SpectroGK, an efficient parallel code. Turbulent fusion plasmas may dissipate free energy through linear phase mixing to fine scales in velocity space, as in Landau damping, or through a nonlinear cascade to fine scales in physical space, as in hydrodynamic turbulence. Using SpectroGK to study saturated electrostatic drift-kinetic turbulence, we find that the nonlinear cascade suppresses linear phase mixing at energetically-dominant scales, so the turbulence is fluid-like. We use this observation to derive Fourier-Hermite spectra for the electrostatic potential and distribution function, and confirm these spectra with simulations.},

abstract = {Four numerical codes are employed to investigate the dynamics of scrape-off layer flaments in tokamak relevant conditions. Experimental measurements were taken in the MAST device using visual camera imaging, which allows the evaluation of the perpendicular size and velocity of the flaments, as well as the combination of density and temperature associated with the perturbation. A new algorithm based on the light emission integrated along the feld lines associated with the position of the flament is developed to ensure that it is properly detected and tracked. The flaments are found to have velocities of the order of − 1 km s 1 , a perpendicular diameter of around 2–3 cm and a density amplitude 2–3.5 times the background plasma. 3D and 2D numerical codes (the STORM module of BOUT++, GBS, HESEL and TOKAM3X) are used to reproduce the motion of the observed flaments with the purpose of validating the codes and of better understanding the experimental data. Good agreement is found between the 3D codes. The seeded flament simulations are also able to reproduce the dynamics observed in experiments with accuracy up to the experimental errorbar levels. In addition, the numerical results showed that flaments characterised by similar size and light emission intensity can have quite different dynamics if the pressure perturbation is distributed differently between density and temperature components. As an additional beneft, several observations on the dynamics of the flaments in the presence of evolving temperature felds were made and led to a better understanding of the behaviour of these coherent structures.},

abstract = {We study turbulence on closed and open flux surfaces in a comparative manner using the three-dimensional electromagnetic gyrofluid turbulence code GEM. A magnetic field on a tokamak is doubly periodic and sheared. This leads to the so-called field line connection, which ensures a finite parallel response for every degree of freedom. In contrast, in the scrape-off layer (SOL), the field lines end on plates, breaking this constraint and allowing the existence of convective cell modes. Since the parallel electron response provides a path to dissipation, whether or not it is allowed to vanish is important. For the SOL case, a standard Debye sheath model is used to provide the parallel boundary conditions. A zero loss model (no fluxes into the plates) is also used to assess the importance of the Debye currents. Turbulence on closed and open flux surfaces at the same parameters is found to be very different, a property which basic transport models should take into account.},

Magnetic reconnection can occur as a result of either electron conductivity and inertia, depending on which one predominates. We eschew the use of an energy dependent collision frequency in the collisional operator model, unlike previous works. A model of the electron conductivity that matches the weakly collisional regime to the exact Landau result at zero collisionality and gives the correct electron isothermal response far from the reconnection region is presented. We identify in the breaking of the constant-{\$}A{\_}{\{}\backslashparallel{\}}{\$} approximation the necessary condition for microtearing instability in the collisional regime.

The collisionless models capture Landau damping through a nonlocal integro-differential sub-diffusion operator with ballistic characteristics. Collisional extensions of Landau fluid models are derived by analyzing the higher order moment equations which combine a Landau closure with collisional friction forces. The model derived here evolves fluid moments for density, parallel velocity, and anisotropic pressure and includes the frictional heat flux, the parallel thermal force and anisotropic electrical conductivity. Since anisotropies must vanish in the collisional limit, a simple closure can be derived if the friction force neglects pitch-angle scattering for the closure moments themselves. The resulting plasma physics model is potentially quite useful for applications in magnetic fusion and astrophysics. ({\textcopyright} 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim).},

@article{Terry2000,
abstract = {The role of stable shear flow in suppressing turbulence and turbulent transport in plasmas and neutral fluids is reviewed. Localized stable flow shear produces transport barriers whose extensive and highly successful utilization in fusion devices has made them the primary experimental technique for reducing and even eliminating the rapid turbulent losses of heat and particles that characterize fusion-grade plasmas. These transport barriers occur in different plasma regions with disparate physical properties and in a range of confining configurations, indicating a physical process of unusual universality. Flow shear suppresses turbulence by speeding up turbulent decorrelation. This is a robust feature of advection whenever the straining rate of stable mean flow shear exceeds the nonlinear decorrelation rate. Shear straining lowers correlation lengths in the direction of shear and reduces turbulent amplitudes. It also disrupts other processes that feed into or result from turbulence, including the linear instability of important collective modes, the transport-producing correlations between advecting fluid and advectants, and large-scale spatially connected avalanchelike transport events. In plasmas, regions of stable flow shear can be externally driven, but most frequently are created spontaneously in critical transitions between different plasma states. Shear suppression occurs in hydrodynamics and represents an extension of rapid-distortion theory to a long-time-scale nonlinear regime in two-dimensional stable shear flow. Examples from hydrodynamics include the emergence of coherent vortices in decaying two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence and the reduction of turbulent transport in the stratosphere.},

For a given set of background scales, the parameter space can be covered by the plasma beta and drift wave collisionality. At large enough plasma beta the turbulence breaks out into ideal ballooning modes and saturates only by depleting the free energy in the background pressure gradient. At high collisionality it finds a more gradual transition to resistive ballooning. At moderate beta and collisionality it retains drift wave character, qualitatively identical to simple two dimensional slab models. The underlying cause is the nonlinear vorticity advection through which the self sustained drift wave turbulence supersedes the linear instabilities, scattering them apart before they can grow, imposing its own physical character on the dynamics. This vorticity advection catalyses the gradient drive, while saturation occurs solely through turbulent mixing of pressure disturbances. This situation persists in the whole of tokamak edge parameter space. Both simplified isothermal models and complete warm ion models are treated.},

abstract = {The mechanisms of turbulent transport in the collisional tokamak edge plasma are investigated linearly and nonlinearly, focusing specifically on the transition from resistive modes to ion temperature gradient driven (eta(i)) modes. Linear eigenvalue calculations demonstrate that resistive ballooning and toroidal eta(i) modes can exist as separate roots with similar growth rates but with differing structure along the magnetic field. While the typical transverse scale length of the resistive modes depends strongly on collisionality, the transverse scales of the eta(i) mode are essentially independent of the collisionality, even in the absence of any assumption on the adiabaticity of the electrons. Three-dimensional nonlinear simulations quantitatively describe the transition between the resistivity dominated outermost edge and regions with moderately higher temperature where resistive modes are stabilized and the collisionless eta(i) mode dominates. A significant result is that the eta(i) modes continue to drive significant particle transport even in regimes where the linear stability analysis indicates the electrons are dominantly adiabatic. The particle transport is driven by the nonadiabatic, long-parallel-wavelength component of the wave spectrum. As in earlier calculations of eta(i) turbulence, the self-generated poloidal flows are relatively strong, much stronger than in cold ion simulations, and strongly influence the saturation levels and associated transport rates. The implications of the results for understanding edge transport and density and temperature profiles are discussed. (C) 1998 American Institute of Physics. [S1070-664X(98)03007-9].},

For wavevectors with a single linear instability, the unstable eigenmode accounts for only one of these degrees of freedom. Little has been known about the role of the remaining fluctuations in the turbulent dynamics. In this paper, these fluctuations are characterized as modes in mode decompositions of gyrokinetic distribution functions from nonlinear simulations. This analysis reveals the excitation of a hierarchy of damped modes at the same perpendicular scales as the driving instabilities. Two effects of these subdominant modes are described: First, these damped modes define a potent energy sink, creating a situation where energy drive and energy dissipation peak at the same perpendicular scales. Second, damped modes with tearing parity (even parity about the outboard midplane for Ajj fluctuations) are driven to significant amplitudes and facilitate the development of magnetic stochasticity in electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations.},

We find an enormous variation in the nonlinear dynamics and particle transport as a function of two main parameters, the density gradient and the plasma collisionality. This variation is explained in part by the damping and stability properties of spontaneously formed zonal flows in the system. As in toroidal systems, the zonal flows can lead to a strong nonlinear suppression of transport below a critical gradient that is determined by the stability of the zonal flows.},

abstract = {Going beyond the linearized study has been a longstanding problem in the theory of Landau damping. In this paper we establish exponential Landau damping in analytic regularity. The damping phenomenon is reinterpreted in terms of transfer of regularity between kinetic and spatial variables, rather than exchanges of energy; phase mixing is the driving mechanism. The analysis involves new families of analytic norms, measuring regularity by comparison with solutions of the free transport equation; new functional inequalities; a control of non-linear echoes; sharp ``deflection'' estimates; and a Newton approximation scheme. Our results hold for any potential no more singular than Coulomb or Newton interaction; the limit cases are included with specific technical effort. As a side result, the stability of homogeneous equilibria of the non-linear Vlasov equation is established under sharp assumptions. We point out the strong analogy with the KAM theory, and discuss physical implications. Finally, we extend these results to some Gevrey (non-analytic) distribution functions.},

abstract = {Describes a series of experiments in the Joint European Torus (JET), culminating in the first tokamak discharges in deuterium-tritium fuelled mixture. The experiments were undertaken within limits imposed by restrictions on vessel activation and tritium usage. The objectives were: (i) to produce more than one megawatt of fusion power in a controlled way; (ii) to validate transport codes and provide a basis for accurately predicting the performance of deuterium-tritium plasmas from measurements made in deuterium plasmas; (iii) to determine tritium retention in the torus systems and to establish the effectiveness of discharge cleaning techniques for tritium removal; (iv) to demonstrate the technology related to tritium usage; and (v) to establish safe procedures for handling tritium in compliance with the regulatory requirements. A single-null X-point magnetic configuration, diverted onto the upper carbon target, with reversed toroidal magnetic field was chosen. Deuterium plasmas were heated by high power, long duration deuterium neutral beams from fourteen sources and fuelled also by up to two neutral beam sources injecting tritium. The results from three of these high performance hot ion H-mode discharges are described: a high performance pure deuterium discharge; a deuterium-tritium discharge with a 1{\%} mixture of tritium fed to one neutral beam source; and a deuterium-tritium discharge with 100{\%} tritium fed to two neutral beam sources. The TRANSP code was used to check the internal consistency of the measured data and to determine the origin of the measured neutron fluxes. In the best deuterium-tritium discharge, the tritium concentration was about 11{\%} at the time of peak performance, when the total neutron emission rate was 6.0 × 10 17 neutrons/s. The integrated total neutron yield over the high power phase, which lasted about 2 s, was 7.2 × 10 17 neutrons, with an accuracy of ±7{\%}. The actual fusion amplification factor, Q DT was about 0.15},

abstract = {The equations governing the guiding center motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field are obtained simultaneously and deductively, without considering individually the special geometric situations in which one effect or another occurs alone. The general expression is derived for the guiding center velocity at right angles to the magnetic field BbdB. This expression contains five terms arising in the presence of an electric field. They are in addition to the usual “E × B” drift. Because these terms are unfamiliar objects in the literature on plasmas, they are illustrated by simple examples. Three of the five drifts occur in rotating plasma machines of the Ixion type. One of these three is also shown to be responsible for the Helmholtz instability of a plasma. A fourth one gives the (low frequency) dielectric constant, while the fifth arises if the direction of B is time dependent. A detailed geometric picture of the fifth drift is given. The equation governing the guiding center motion parallel to B is also derived for the general time-dependent field. The conditions are discussed under which it can be integrated into the form of an energy integral. Finally the component of current density perpendicular to B in a collisionless plasma is shown to be the current due to the guiding center drift plus the perpendicular component of the curl of the magnetic moment per unit volume. Proofs of this have been given in the past for special cases, such as static fields, ∇ × B = 0, etc. This proof holds in general, provided conditions for adiabaticity are met. It is also true, but not proven in this paper, that the component of the current density parallel to B is the current due to the guiding center velocity parallel to B plus the parallel component of the curl of the magnetic moment per unit volume. A proper proof of the parallel component is quite lengthy.},

abstract = {Edge conditions in DIII-D are being quantified in order to provide insight into the physics of the H mode regime. Several studies show that electron temperature is not the key parameter that controls the L-H transition. Gradients of edge temperature and pressure are much more promising candidates for elements of such parameters. They systematically increase during the L phases of discharges which make a transition to H mode, and these increases are typically larger than the increases in the underlying quantities. The quality of H mode confinement is strongly correlated with the height of the H mode pedestal for the pressure. The gradient of the pressure is limited by MHD modes, in particular by ideal kink ballooning modes with finite mode number n. For a wide variety of discharges, the width of the barrier for electron pressure is well described by a relationship that is proportional to ($\beta$ ped p ) 1/2 . A new regime of confinement, called the quiescent H mode, which provides steady state operation with no ELMs, low radiated power and normal H mode confinement, has been discovered. A coherent edge MHD mode provides adequate particle transport to control the plasma density while permitting the pressure pedestal to remain almost identical to that observed in ELMing discharges.},

abstract = {This paper presents a model of the linear acoustic propagation in axisymmetric waveguides, the pressure depending on a single space variable. The approach consists of writing the wave equation and the boundary conditions for a coordinate system rectifying the isobaric map at each time. The two-dimensional dependence of the problem is thus transferred from the pressure to the coefficients of the wave equation. From this result, an exclusively geometrical necessary condition is deduced for the admissibility of isobaric maps. However, the knowledge of the waveguide geometry is not sufficient to separate the pressure and the isobaric map solutions. In order to develop a unidimensional wave equation, a geometrical hypothesis is discussed. For lossless and motionless rigid waveguides, the deduced equation leads to exact results for tubes and cones. It may be interpreted as a Webster equation for a particular coordinate system so that the particular profiles for which analytical solutions of the pressure exist are redefined. The wave equation is also established for pipes with visco-thermal losses and, more generally, for mobile walls having a small admittance. The compatibility of the geometrical hypothesis with the exact model is specified for this general case.},

However, this new set of equations still has conservation properties and, in the absence of fluctuations, recovers the usual MHD equilibrium. Furthermore, the resulting equations allow for the plasma pressure balance to be further modified by finite-Larmor-radius effects in regions with steep pressure gradients.

abstract = {We construct a magnetic helicity conserving dynamo theory that incorporates a calculated magnetic helicity current. In this model the fluid helicity plays a small role in large-scale magnetic field generation. Instead, the dynamo process is dominated by a new quantity, derived from asymmetries in the second derivative of the velocity correlation function, closely related to the ``twist and fold'' dynamo model. The turbulent damping term is, as expected, almost unchanged. Numerical simulations with a spatially constant fluid helicity and vanishing resistivity are not expected to generate large-scale fields in equipartition with the turbulent energy density. The prospects for driving a fast dynamo under these circumstances are uncertain, but if it is possible, then the field must be largely force-free. On the other hand, there is an efficient analog to the $\alpha$-$\Omega$ dynamo. Systems whose turbulence is driven by some anisotropic local instability in a shearing flow, like real stars and accretion disks, and some computer simulations may successfully drive the generation of strong large-scale magnetic fields, provided that ∂r$\Omega${\textless}∂$\theta$vz$\omega$$\theta${\textgreater}{\textgreater}0. We show that this criterion is usually satisfied. Such dynamos will include a persistent, spatially coherent vertical magnetic helicity current with the same sign as -∂r$\Omega$, that is, positive for an accretion disk and negative for the Sun. We comment on the role of random magnetic helicity currents in storing turbulent energy in a disordered magnetic field, which will generate an equipartition, disordered field in a turbulent medium, and also a declining long-wavelength tail to the power spectrum. As a result, calculations of the Galactic ``seed'' field are largely irrelevant.},

We describe the propagation of free energy in Fourier–Hermite phase space using forwards and backwards propagating Hermite modes recently developed for gyrokinetic theory. We derive a free energy equation that relates the change in the electric field to the net Hermite flux out of the zeroth Hermite mode. In linear Landau damping, decay in the electric field corresponds to forward propagating Hermite modes; in nonlinear damping, the initial decay is followed by a growth phase characterized by the generation of backwards propagating Hermite modes by the nonlinear term. The free energy content of the backwards propagating modes increases exponentially until balancing that of the forward propagating modes. Thereafter there is no systematic net Hermite flux, so the electric field cannot decay and the nonlinearity effectively suppresses Landau damping. These simulations are performed using the fully-spectral 5D gyrokinetics code SpectroGK, modified to solve the 1+1D Vlasov–Poisson system. This captures Landau damping via Hou–Li filtering in velocity space. Therefore the code is applicable even in regimes where phase mixing and filamentation are dominant.},

abstract = {The field line connection of a tokamak sheared magnetic field ensures a finite parallel dynamical response for every degree of freedom available in the system. In the scrape-off layer (SOL) the flux surfaces are open, and the field line connection property is broken by the presence of a Debye sheath arising where the field lines strike boundary plates, hence allowing the existence of convective cell modes for which there is no dynamical parallel response. This leads to a major distinction in terms of turbulence character between closed and open flux surface regions. We study this using three-dimensional electromagnetic gyrofluid computations. The turbulence is found to change character from an ion temperature gradient to a generic interchange type, crossing the last closed flux surface (LCFS) radially outward. The width of the transition zone is about ten ion gyroradii. Various poloidal configurations of the Debye sheaths retain this interface property but affect the interaction between the turbulence and the slowly varying, self-consistent background. The strongest effect is found in a case with sheath plates at both the top and bottom of the SOL, allowing the high-field and low-field sides of the SOL to decouple. In these sides the curvature is favourable and unfavourable, respectively. The clear asymmetry observed between these sides of the plasma is consistent with previous experimental results and makes room for future experimental qualitative comparisons, for instance, on double null configurations of the tokamak ASDEX Upgrade},

abstract = {The problem of Landau damping of longitudinal plasma oscillations is investigated by dividing the plasma electrons into two groups. The first group is the main plasma and consists of all electrons with velocities considerably different from the wave velocity while the second group, the resonant electrons, consists of all electrons with velocities near the wave velocity. It is assumed that initially the main plasma has a wave on it while the resonant particles are undisturbed. It is shown that equating the gain in energy of the resonant particles to the loss in energy of the wave gives the correct Landau damping. Only first‐order quantities are used in the analysis so that particle trapping which is a nonlinear effect is not involved. The validity of arguments which attribute Landau damping to particle trapping is discussed. The breakdown of the linearized theory and the Galilean invariance of the damping are also investigated.},

abstract = {Reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling has been associated with longevity in various model organisms. However, the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in human survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to test whether circulating IGF-1 axis parameters associate with old age survival and functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study. This study examined 858 Dutch nonagenarian (males≥89 years; females≥91 years) siblings from 409 families, without selection on health or demographic characteristics. Nonagenarians were divided over sex-specific strata according to their levels of IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3 and IGF-1/IGFBP3 molar ratio. We found that lower IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratios were associated with improved survival: nonagenarians in the quartile of the lowest ratio had a lower estimated hazard ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) of 0.73 (0.59 – 0.91) compared to the quartile with the highest ratio (ptrend=0.002). Functional status was assessed by (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) scales. Compared to those in the quartile with the highest IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, nonagenarians in the lowest quartile had higher scores for ADL (ptrend=0.001) and IADL (ptrend=0.003). These findings suggest that IGF-1 axis parameters are associated with increased old age survival and better functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study.},

The moment hierarchy is closed with approximations that model the kinetic effects of parallel Landau damping, toroidal drift resonances, and finite Larmor radius effects. These equations generalize the work of Dorland and Hammett [Phys. Fluids B 5, 812 (1993)] to toroidal geometry by including essential toroidal effects. The closures for phase mixing from toroidal del B and curvature drifts take the basic form presented in Waltz et al. [Phys. Fluids B 4, 3138 (1992)], but here a more rigorous procedure is used, including an extension to higher moments, which provides significantly improved accuracy. In addition, trapped ion effects and collisions are incorporated. This reduced set of nonlinear equations accurately models most of the physics considered important for ion dynamics in core tokamak turbulence, and is simple enough to be used in high resolution direct numerical simulations.

The newly formed blobs transport azimuthal momentum up the gradient of the azimuthal flow and drive the zonal-flow shear while moving outwards. During this process energy is transferred from the meso-scale coherent structures to the zonal flows via the turbulent Reynolds stress, resulting in nonlinear saturation of edge turbulence and suppression of meso-scale fluctuations.

In order to understand this critical observation, a multi-scale turbulence-neoclassical simulation of integrated edge-core plasma in a realistic diverted geometry is a necessity, but has been a formidable task. Thanks to the recent development in high performance computing, we have succeeded in the integrated multiscale gyrokinetic simulation of the ion-temperature-gradient driven turbulence in realistic diverted tokamak geometry for the first time.

The parallel moment equations are derived from the drift kinetic equation with the exact linearized Landau operator and analytically solved for the heat flux in integral form. Quantitative analysis of the integral heat flux for sinusoidal temperature profiles shows that the number of moments required for convergence increases as collision length increases. The integral heat flux well agrees with the Braginskii heat flux and the collisionless heat flux for high and low collisionalities, respectively. Incorrect application of the Braginskii heat flux in moderately collisional or nearly collisionless plasmas often leads higher heat flux than the integral closure. This fact is consistent with numerical studies of electron heat confinement in the sustained spheromak physics experiment [Hooper et al., Nucl. Fusion39, 863 (1999)] which show a modest (6{\%}) increase in core temperature when the integral heat flux is adopted.},

We begin with the view that one of the main goals of the theory is to better understand the nature of black holes themselves. In this light we discuss how accretion disks might reveal some of the unique signatures of strong gravity: the event horizon, the innermost stable circular orbit, and the ergosphere. We then review, from a first-principles perspective, the physical processes at play in accretion disks. This leads us to the four primary accretion disk models that we review: Polish doughnuts (thick disks), Shakura-Sunyaev (thin) disks, slim disks, and advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). After presenting the models we discuss issues of stability, oscillations, and jets. Following our review of the analytic work, we take a parallel approach in reviewing numerical studies of black hole accretion disks. We finish with a few select applications that highlight particular astrophysical applications: measurements of black hole mass and spin, black hole vs. neutron star accretion disks, black hole accretion disk spectral states, and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).},

Strictly necessary information about the Modern Gyrokinetic formalism is given together with the consistent derivation of the gyrokinetic Maxwell-Vlasov equations from the first principle of dynamics. Variational formulation of dynamics is also used for simultaneously obtaining the corresponding exact energy conservation law. The result of that explicit derivation is used for verification of the energy conservation diagnostics currently implemented in ORB5 code.

Besides neoclassical transport, a term for divergence of anomalous kinetic radial flux is added to mock up the effect of turbulent transport. To study the relative roles of neoclassical and anomalous transport, TEMPEST simulations were carried out for plasma transport and flow dynamics in a single-null tokamak geometry, including the pedestal region that extends across the separatrix into the scrape-off layer and private flux region. A series of TEMPEST simulations were conducted to investigate the transition of midplane pedestal heat flux and flow from the neoclassical to the turbulent limit and the transition of divertor heat flux and flow from the kinetic to the fluid regime via an anomalous transport scan and a density scan. The TEMPEST simulation results demonstrate that turbulent transport (as modelled by large diffusion) plays a similar role to collisional decorrelation of particle orbits and that the large turbulent transport (large diffusion) leads to an apparent Maxwellianization of the particle distribution. We also show the transition of parallel heat flux and flow at the entrance to the divertor plates from the fluid to the kinetic regime. For an absorbing divertor plate boundary condition, a non-half-Maxwellian is found due to the balance between upstream radial anomalous transport and energetic ion endloss.},

abstract = {There is currently both considerable interest in the physics of ELM transport in the scrape-off layer (SOL) and concern over the impact of the ELM power and particle loads on the divertor targets of future fusion reactors. This paper describes some experimental observations of the reaction of target floating potentials and currents during ELMS in TCV, relying principally on fast measurements of these parameters using tile embedded Langmuir probe arrays. Clear evidence is presented for rapid modifications in the local target floating potentials occurring long before the characteristic rise of hydrogenic excitation emission due to local recycling provoked by the arrival at the target of the ELM ion flux. This precursor activity appears to be synchronous with the growth of MHD modes in the main chamber. Simple conditional averaging is used to derive a 'coherent ELM' and thus generate the radial distribution of the current to probes held at the target potential. At some locations, the coherent ELM can also be used to estimate the time evolution of the local target electron temperature, density and power flux, even though these quantities are not directly measured. The time delays between the reactions of currents, floating potentials and derived temperature are consistent with the expections of recently published kinetic simulations of ELM energy transport down a one-dimensional SOL plasma. The strong potential variations observed during the ELM are the result of current flows at the targets. These currents are generally of opposite sign at inner and outer divertors and are thus consistent, at least in part, with a thermoelectric origin in which the driven current is produced by an in/out divertor temperature asymmetry near the strike point of nearly a factor 2, probably due to the generation of divertor asymmetries by the ELM heat pulse. Such asymmetries are commonly observed in low to medium density L-modes for the particular TCV magnetic equilibrium studied in this paper. The total current balance during the ELM is satisfied only to within a factor 2, so that, whilst some of the driven current flows parallel to field lines in the SOL, there is an apparent additional negative current to the inner divertor during the ELM whose origin remains unexplained. It might, however, be due, in part, to increased plasma-wall interaction in the main chamber during the ELM event.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional (3-D) simulations of drift-resistive ballooning turbulence are presented. The turbulence is basically controlled by a parameter alpha, the ratio of the drift wave frequency to the ideal ballooning growth rate. If this parameter is small [alpha less than or equal to 1, corresponding to Ohmic (OH) or low confinement phase (L-mode) plasmas], the system is dominated by ballooning turbulence, which is strongly peaked at the outside of the torus. If it is large [alpha greater than or equal to 1, corresponding to high confinement phase (H-mode) plasmas], field line curvature plays a minor role. The turbulence is nonlinearly sustained even if curvature is removed and all modes are linearly stable due to magnetic shear. In the nonlinear regime without curvature the system obeys a different scaling law compared to the low-alpha regime. The transport scaling is discussed in both regimes and the implications for OH, L-mode, and H-mode transport are discussed. (C) 1996 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {In 1998, after six years of joint work originally foreseen under the ITER engineering design activities (EDA) agreement, a design for ITER had been developed fulfilling all objectives and the cost target adopted by the ITER parties in 1992 at the start of the EDA. While accepting this design, the ITER parties recognized the possibility that they might be unable, for financial reasons, to proceed to the construction of the then foreseen device. The focus of effort in the ITER EDA since 1998 has been the development of a new design to meet revised technical objectives and a cost reduction target of about 50{\%} of the previously accepted cost estimate. The rationale for the choice of parameters of the design has been based largely on system analysis drawing on the design solutions already developed and using the latest physics results and outputs from technology R{\&}D projects. In so doing the joint central team and home teams converge towards a new design which will allow the exploration of a range of burning plasma conditions. The new ITER design, whilst having reduced technical objectives from its predecessor, will nonetheless meet the programmatic objective of providing an integrated demonstration of the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy. Background, design features, performance, safety features, and R{\&}D and future perspectives of the ITER design are discussed.},

@article{Schekochihin2016,
abstract = {A scaling theory of long-wavelength electrostatic turbulence in a magnetised, weakly collisional plasma (e.g., ITG turbulence) is proposed, with account taken both of the nonlinear advection of the perturbed particle distribution by fluctuating ExB flows and of its phase mixing, which is caused by the streaming of the particles along the mean magnetic field and, in a linear problem, would lead to Landau damping. It is found that it is possible to construct a consistent theory in which very little free energy leaks into high velocity moments of the distribution function, rendering the turbulent cascade in the energetically relevant part of the wave-number space essentially fluid-like. The velocity-space spectra of free energy expressed in terms of Hermite-moment orders are steep power laws and so the free-energy content of the phase space does not diverge at infinitesimal collisionality (while it does for a linear problem); collisional heating due to long-wavelength perturbations vanishes in this limit (also in contrast with the linear problem, in which it occurs at the finite rate equal to the Landau-damping rate). The ability of the free energy to stay in the low velocity moments of the distribution function is facilitated by the "anti-phase-mixing" effect, whose presence in the nonlinear system is due to the stochastic version of the plasma echo (the advecting velocity couples the phase-mixing and anti-phase-mixing perturbations). The partitioning of the wave-number space between the (energetically dominant) region where this is the case and the region where linear phase mixing wins its competition with nonlinear advection is governed by the "critical balance" between linear and nonlinear timescales (which for high Hermite moments splits into two thresholds, one demarcating the wave-number region where phase mixing predominates, the other where plasma echo does).},

abstract = {We report on the algorithms and numerical methods used in Viriato, a novel fluid-kinetic code that solves two distinct sets of equations: (i) the Kinetic Reduced Electron Heating Model (KREHM) equations (Zocco and Schekochihin, 2011) (which reduce to the standard Reduced-MHD equations in the appropriate limit) and (ii) the kinetic reduced MHD (KRMHD) equations (Schekochihin et al., 2009). Two main applications of these equations are magnetized (Alfv{\'{e}}nic) plasma turbulence and magnetic reconnection. Viriato uses operator splitting (Strang or Godunov) to separate the dynamics parallel and perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field (assumed strong). Along the magnetic field, Viriato allows for either a second-order accurate MacCormack method or, for higher accuracy, a spectral-like scheme composed of the combination of a total variation diminishing (TVD) third order Runge-Kutta method for the time derivative with a 7th order upwind scheme for the fluxes. Perpendicular to the field Viriato is pseudo-spectral, and the time integration is performed by means of an iterative predictor-corrector scheme. In addition, a distinctive feature of Viriato is its spectral representation of the parallel velocity-space dependence, achieved by means of a Hermite representation of the perturbed distribution function. A series of linear and nonlinear benchmarks and tests are presented, including a detailed analysis of 2D and 3D Orszag-Tang-type decaying turbulence, both in fluid and kinetic regimes.},

The scale and the anisotropy of self-organized turbulent structures vary depending on the Rhines scale and the characteristic scale given by the adiabatic response term in the HM equation. The former is determined by competition between the linear wave dispersion and the nonlinear turbulent cascade, while the latter is given as the scale, at which the turbulent cascade is impeded. These scales are controlled by plasma parameters such as the density and temperature gradient, and the temperature ratio of ion to electron. It is found that depending on the plasma parameters, the ETG turbulence shows either isotropic turbulence or zonal flows, which give significantly different transport levels. Although the modulational instability excites zonal modes regardless of the plasma parameters, the final turbulent structure is determined by the self-organization process.},

A particular effort is made to tie together various aspects of charged particle diffusion phenomena in quiescent, partially ionized plasmas. The concepts of diffusion length and effective diffusion coefficient and the treatment of partially reflecting boundaries are developed in the limit of the space-charge-free motion of the electrons or ions. A simplified derivation of the screening length for space charge electric fields is followed by a review of the conventional derivation of diffusion in the ambipolar limit. A discussion of the scaling parameters of the ratio of the diffusion length to the screening length and the ratio of the diffusion length to the ion mean-free-path leads to a map used to correlate published models covering the complete range of these parameters. The models of measurements of the diffusion of electrons, several types of positive ions, and negative ions are reviewed. The role of diffusion in the decay of charged particle densities and wall currents during the afterglow of a discharge is then considered. The effects of collapse of the space charge field and of diffusion cooling are reviewed. Finally, the application of the diffusion models to a number of different discharges is discussed.},

Alternatively, Braginskii's two-fluid transport equations may be used with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to derive an analytic expression for the fluctuation spectrum, which gives the relation of the thermal transport coefficients to the spectrum.

abstract = {In some cases, the phase shift between fluctuations of the electric potential and plasma density helps to identify the instability that governs the turbulent state. In this paper, the basic experimental and theoretical results that denote the possibility (or impossibility) of such identification are briefly discussed. The experimental data based on measurements of the phase shift between the floating potential and ion saturation current fluctuations in the L-2M stellarator-a system with externally imposed magnetic surfaces-are presented (Shchepetov, Kholnov, Fedyanin, et al., Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 50, 045001 (2008)). It is shown that the observed phase shift Omega varies in a wide range from pi to 0, gradually decreasing with deepening inside the plasma. A number of arguments are presented suggesting that Omega a parts per thousand pi can indicate that the process is nonlocal, i.e., oscillations at a given spatial point are driven and mainly determined by the processes localized outside of the observation point. We note that, within the framework of the magnetohydrodynamic theory, plasma was definitely unstable with respect to resistive interchange modes in all cases under study. It is demonstrated experimentally that the widespread notion that the phase shift Omega a parts per thousand pi/2 is characteristic of only resistive interchange modes is hardly universal. The experimental results are analyzed on the basis of analytical estimates.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional turbulence simulation of the SOL and edge regions of a toroidally limited
tokamak is carried out. The simulation couples self-consistently the drift-reduced two-fluid
Braginskii equations to a kinetic equation for neutral atoms. A diagnostic neutral gas puff on
the low-field side midplane is included and the impact of neutral density fluctuations on D$\alpha$
light emission investigated. We find that neutral density fluctuations affect the D$\alpha$ emission.
In particular, at a radial distance from the gas puff smaller than the neutral mean free path,
neutral density fluctuations are anti-correlated with plasma density, electron temperature, and
D$\alpha$ fluctuations. It follows that the neutral fluctuations reduce the D$\alpha$ emission in most of the
observed region and, therefore, have to be taken into account when interpreting the amplitude
of the D$\alpha$ emission. On the other hand, higher order statistical moments (skewness, kurtosis)
and turbulence characteristics (such as correlation length, or the autocorrelation time) are
not significantly affected by the neutral fluctuations. At distances from the gas puff larger
than the neutral mean free path, a non-local shadowing effect influences the neutral density
fluctuations. There, the D$\alpha$ fluctuations are correlated with the neutral density fluctuations,
and the high-order statistical moments and measurements of other turbulence properties are
strongly affected by the neutral density fluctuations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In an era of increased emphasis on patient safety and competency-based education, demonstration of significant variability in the teaching of flexible bronchoscopy has led to initiatives for new standardized curricula and assessment tools. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of such curricula and to assess bronchoscopic skill, 2 measuring instruments have been developed: the Bronchoscopy Skills and Tasks Assessment Tool (BSTAT) and the Bronchoscopy Step-by-Step Evaluation Tool (BSET). We studied the validity and reliability of these 2 instruments. METHODS: Two independent testers simultaneously scored 22 volunteer participants at 3 levels [novice (n = 7), fellow (n = 8) and attending (n = 7)] on a virtual reality bronchoscopy simulator using the 2 instruments; each participant was tested twice, in 2 separate sessions. Intertester and test-retest reliability were analyzed with intraclass correlations (ICC); ANOVA was used to assess concurrent validity based on the subjects' expected skill level. RESULTS: The ICCs between the testers were 0.98 for both the BSTAT and BSET. Comparison of the scores between the sessions showed high test-retest reliability by ICC (0.86 and 0.85 for BSTAT and BSET respectively), with a small yet statistically significant learning effect. The novice group's scores were lower than the fellows' and attendings' (p {\textless} 0.001) for both the BSTAT and BSET; the fellows' scores were consistently lower than the attendings' on both tests, yet the differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This validation study of 2 objective tests of bronchoscopic skill demonstrated high reliability and concurrent validity. These instruments can now be used to evaluate the effectiveness of new competency-based bronchoscopy curricula.},

abstract = {The edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) region of a tokamak plasma is considered, with emphasis on sheared flow generation and the dynamics of blob-filaments. Both numerical simulations and experimental data analysis are employed. The simulations use the fluid-based two-dimensional (2D) curvature-interchange model embedded in the SOLT code. A blob-tracking algorithm based on 2D time-resolved images from the gas puff imaging diagnostic has also been developed and applied to NSTX, Alcator C-Mod and simulation data. The algorithm is able to track the blob motion and changes in blob structure, such as elliptical deformations, that can be affected by sheared flows. Results of seeded blob simulations and quasi-steady turbulence simulations are compared with the experimental data to determine the role of plasma parameters on the blob tracks and to evaluate the exchange of momentum between the blobs and flows. The simulations are shown to reproduce many qualitative and quantitative features of the data including size, scale-length and direction of perpendicular (approximately poloidal) flows, the inferred Reynolds acceleration and residual stress, poloidal reversal of blob tracks, and blob trapping and/or ejection. Mechanisms related to blob motion, SOL currents and radial inhomogeneity are shown to be sufficient to explain the presence or absence of mean and oscillating zonal sheared flows in selected shots.},

abstract = {The 1990 National Academy of Science final report of its review of the Inertial Confinement Fusion Program recommended completion of a series of target physics objectives on the 10-beam Nova laser at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as the highest-priority prerequisite for proceeding with construction of an ignition-scale laser facility, now called the National Ignition Facility (NIF). These objectives were chosen to demonstrate that there was sufficient understanding of the physics of ignition targets that the laser requirements for laboratory ignition could be accurately specified. This research on Nova, as well as additional research on the Omega laser at the University of Rochester, is the subject of this review. The objectives of the U.S. indirect-drive target physics program have been to experimentally demonstrate and predictively modelhohlraum characteristics, as well as capsule performance in targets that have been scaled in key physics variables from NIF targets. To address the hohlraum and hydrodynamic constraints on indirect-drive ignition, the target physics program was divided into the Hohlraum and Laser–Plasma Physics (HLP) program and the Hydrodynamically Equivalent Physics(HEP) program. The HLP program addresses laser–plasma coupling, x-ray generation and transport, and the development of energy-efficient hohlraums that provide the appropriate spectral, temporal, and spatial x-ray drive. The HEP experiments address the issues of hydrodynamic instability and mix, as well as the effects of flux asymmetry on capsules that are scaled as closely as possible to ignition capsules (hydrodynamic equivalence). The HEP program also addresses other capsule physics issues associated with ignition, such as energy gain and energy loss to the fuel during implosion in the absence of alpha-particle deposition. The results from the Nova and Omega experiments approach the NIF requirements for most of the important ignition capsule parameters, including drive temperature, drive symmetry, and hydrodynamic instability. This paper starts with a review of the NIF target designs that have formed the motivation for the goals of the target physics program. Following that are theoretical and experimental results from Nova and Omega relevant to the requirements of those targets. Some elements of this work were covered in a 1995 review of indirect-drive [J. D. Lindl, “Development of the indirect-drive approach to inertial confinement fusion and the target physics basis for ignition and gain,” Phys. Plasmas 2, 3933 (1995)]. In order to present as complete a picture as possible of the research that has been carried out on indirect drive, key elements of that earlier review are also covered here, along with a review of work carried out since 1995.},

It i s difficult to draw definite conclusions from measurements of the global energy containment time even in the quasi-steady phase of those ohmically heated discharges, which do not exhibit gross instability or appreciable effects due to runaway electrons. However, comparison of particle and energy confinement suggests that the loss process i s mainly conduction rather than convection. In order to separate the various energy input and loss mechanisms the assumptions of classical ohmic heating and equipartition are made. The experimental evidence for these assumptions i s presented. The dominant energy transport process i s electron thermal conduction, for which a formalism i s suggested for comparing experimental data with various theoretical models. Particle and iimpurity transport appears to require the neoclassical pinch tenn in addition to anomalous particle diffusion at a significantly lower rate than electron conduction.

These low‐frequency (reduced) fluid equations contain terms of arbitrary order in ϵ⊥ and take into account the nonuniformity in the equilibrium density and temperature of the ion and electron species, as well as the nonuniformity in the equilibrium magnetic field. From the gyrofluid equations, one can systematically derive nonlinear reduced fluid equations with finite‐Larmor‐radius (FLR) corrections, which contain linear and nonlinear terms of O(ϵ⊥), by expressing the gyrocenter‐fluid moments appearing in the gyrofluid equations in terms of the particle‐fluid moments, and then keeping terms up to O(ϵ⊥) in the ϵ⊥ expansion of the gyrofluid equations. By using gyrocenter‐fluid moments, this new gyrofluid approach effectively bypasses the issue of the gyroviscous cancellations, while retaining all the important diamagnetic effects and the gyroviscous corrections. From the present FLR‐corrected reduced fluid equations, the reduced Braginskii equations are recoverd for the ion and electron species (without collisional dissipation) and the ideal reduced magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations (in the absence of FLR effects).$\backslash$n$\backslash$ngyrocenter-fluid $\chi$moment; $\epsilon$⊥≡(k⊥$\rho$i)2≂O(1) 2？},

abstract = {The problem of the derivation of hydrodynamics from the Boltzmann equation and related dissipative systems is formulated as the problem of a slow invariant manifold in the space of distributions. We review a few instances where such hydrodynamic manifolds were found analytically both as the result of summation of the Chapman-Enskog asymptotic expansion and by the direct solution of the invariance equation. These model cases, comprising Grad's moment systems, both linear and nonlinear, are studied in depth in order to gain understanding of what can be expected for the Boltzmann equation. Particularly, the dispersive dominance and saturation of dissipation rate of the exact hydrodynamics in the short-wave limit and the viscosity modification at high divergence of the flow velocity are indicated as severe obstacles to the resolution of Hilbert's 6th Problem. Furthermore, we review the derivation of the approximate hydrodynamic manifold for the Boltzmann equation using Newton's iteration and avoiding smallness parameters, and compare this to the exact solutions. Additionally, we discuss the problem of projection of the Boltzmann equation onto the approximate hydrodynamic invariant manifold using entropy concepts. Finally, a set of hypotheses is put forward where we describe open questions and set a horizon for what can be derived exactly or proven about the hydrodynamic manifolds for the Boltzmann equation in the future.},

In the toroidal system studied, the eigenmodes are seen to possess (i) an elongated, nearly global radial extent, (ii) a higher growth rate than in the corresponding cylindrical system, (iii) an eigenfrequency nearly constant with radius, and (iv) a global temperature relaxation and enhancement of thermal heat conduction.

@article{Abel2013,
abstract = {This paper presents a complete theoretical framework for studying turbulence and transport in rapidly rotating tokamak plasmas. The fundamental scale separations present in plasma turbulence are codified as an asymptotic expansion in the ratio $\epsilon$ = $\rho$i/$\alpha$ of the gyroradius to the equilibrium scale length. Proceeding order by order in this expansion, a set of coupled multiscale equations is developed. They describe an instantaneous equilibrium, the fluctuations driven by gradients in the equilibrium quantities, and the transport-timescale evolution of mean profiles of these quantities driven by the interplay between the equilibrium and the fluctuations. The equilibrium distribution functions are local Maxwellians with each flux surface rotating toroidally as a rigid body. The magnetic equilibrium is obtained from the generalized Grad-Shafranov equation for a rotating plasma, determining the magnetic flux function from the mean pressure and velocity profiles of the plasma. The slow (resistive-timescale) evolution of the magnetic field is given by an evolution equation for the safety factor q. Large-scale deviations of the distribution function from a Maxwellian are given by neoclassical theory. The fluctuations are determined by the 'high-flow' gyrokinetic equation, from which we derive the governing principle for gyrokinetic turbulence in tokamaks: the conservation and local (in space) cascade of the free energy of the fluctuations (i.e. there is no turbulence spreading). Transport equations for the evolution of the mean density, temperature and flow velocity profiles are derived. These transport equations show how the neoclassical and fluctuating corrections to the equilibrium Maxwellian act back upon the mean profiles through fluxes and heating. The energy and entropy conservation laws for the mean profiles are derived from the transport equations. Total energy, thermal, kinetic and magnetic, is conserved and there is no net turbulent heating. Entropy is produced by the action of fluxes flattening gradients, Ohmic heating and the equilibration of interspecies temperature differences. This equilibration is found to include both turbulent and collisional contributions. Finally, this framework is condensed, in the low-Mach-number limit, to a more concise set of equations suitable for numerical implementation.},

abstract = {The gyrokinetic derivation of [A.M. Dimits, L.L. LoDestro, D.H.E. Dubin, Phys. Fluids B4, 274 (1992).] is extended to general equilibrium magnetic fields. The result is a practical set equations that is valid for large perturbation amplitudes [q*psi/T=O(1), where psi=phi-v*A{\_}||/c] but which is much simpler, easier to implement, and has more straightforward expressions for its conservation properties than the equation sets derived in the large-flow orderings. Here, phi and A{\_}|| are the perturbed electrostatic and parallel magnetic potentials, v is the particle velocity, c is the speed of light, and T is the temperature. The derivation is based on the quantity epsilon=(rho/lambda)*q*psi/T as the small expansion parameter, where rho is the gyroradius and lambda is the perpendicular wavelength. Physically, this means that the ExB velocity and the component of the parallel velocity perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field are small compared to the thermal velocity. For nonlinear fluctuations saturated at mixing-length levels (e.g., with q*psi/T {\~{}}lambda/L, where L is the equilibrium profile scale length), epsilon is of order rho/L for all scales lambda ranging from rho to L, even though q*psi/T=O(1) for lambda {\~{}}L. We anticipate that our equations will be useful as a basis for simulation models edge and screapeoff layer regions as well as internal transport barriers in tokamaks, where the separation between the profile and gyroradius scales is relatively modest, and the significant fluctuations have wavelengths (of the order of 10-100 gyroradii) that may be comparable to the scale of profile variations.},

Nonlinear 3-D simulations of toroidal ITG-driven turbulence indicate that turbulence-generated sheared flows play an important role in the development and saturation of the turbulence. There is a strong enhancement of the flows when the electrons are assumed adiabatic on each flux surface, which is partially offset by toroidal drift effects which reduce the flows.},

Here we study the effect on recurrence of artificial collisions modeled through the Lenard-Bernstein operator [A. Lenard and I. B. Bernstein, Phys. Rev. 112, 1456-1459 (1958)]. By decomposing the linear Vlasov-Poisson system in the Fourier-Hermite space, the recurrence problem is investigated in the linear regime of the damping of a Langmuir wave and of the onset of the bump-on-tail instability. The analysis is then confirmed and extended to the nonlinear regime through a Eulerian collisional Vlasov-Poisson code. It is found that, despite being routinely used, an artificial collisionality is not a viable way of preventing recurrence in numerical simulations without compromising the kinetic nature of the solution. Moreover, it is shown how numerical effects associated to the generation of fine velocity scales, can modify the physical features of the system evolution even in nonlinear regime. This means that filamentation-like phenomena, usually associated with low amplitude fluctuations contexts, can play a role even in nonlinear regime.},

The gyrocenter collision operator consists of drift and diffusion terms in the gyrocenter coordinates, including the diffusion of the gyrocenter, which does not exist for the collision operator in the particle phase space coordinates. The gyrocenter collision operator also depends on the transverse electric field explicitly, which is crucial for the correct treatment of collisional effects and transport in the gyrocenter coordinates. The gyrocenter collision operator derived is applied to calculate the particle and heat transport fluxes in a magnetized Lorentz plasma with an electric field. The particle and heat transport fluxes calculated from our gyrocenter collision operator agree exactly with the classical Braginskii's result [ S. I.

This could imply a limit cycle-type behavior for black hole accretion flows with accretion rates close ot the Eddington one.},

abstract = {In the simple magnetized torus TORPEX, field-aligned blobs originate from ideal interchange waves and propagate radially outward due to del B and curvature induced drifts. Time-resolved two-dimensional measurements of the field-aligned current density J(parallel to) associated with blobs are obtained from conditionally sampled data from a single-sided Langmuir probe and a specially designed current probe. The profile of J(parallel to) exhibits an asymmetric dipolar structure, which originates from the polarization of the blob and is consistent with sheath boundary conditions. The asymmetry results from the non-linear dependence of J(parallel to) at the sheath edge upon the floating potential. Using internal measurements, we directly confirm the existence of two regimes, in which parallel currents to the sheath do or do not significantly damp charge separation and thus blob radial velocity. To investigate the effect of the observed asymmetry of J(parallel to) on the blob motion, we carried out numerical simulations of seeded blobs, using a two-field fluid model, which evolves electron density and vorticity. Simulations are performed spanning a wide range of blob sizes covering both regimes. We use either the complete or a linearized form for the sheath dissipation term in the vorticity equation. The structure of the parallel current density and plasma potential is found to be different in the two cases. Asymmetric profiles are observed in simulations with the complete form, while symmetric profiles are obtained when a linearized form is used. Negligible effects are, however, observed in terms of blob radial velocity. The relevance of the present results for fusion devices is also discussed.},

abstract = {Edge-localized-modes (ELMs) are a ubiquitous feature of H-mode in tokamaks. When gradients in the H-mode transport barrier grow to exceed the MHD stability limit the ELM instability grows explosively, rapidly transporting energy and particles onto open field lines and material surfaces. Though ELMs provide additional particle and impurity transport through the H-mode transport barrier, enabling steady operation, the resulting heat flux transients to plasma facing surfaces project to large amplitude in future low collisionality burning plasma tokamaks. Measurements of the ELM heat flux deposition onto material surfaces in the divertor and main chamber indicate significant broadening compared to inter-ELM heat flux, with a timescale for energy deposition that is consistent with sonic ion flow and numerical simulation. Comprehensive ELM simulation is highlighting the important physics processes of ELM transport including parallel transport due to magnetic reconnection and turbulence resulting from collapse of the H-mode transport barrier. Encouraging prospects for ELM control and/or suppression in future tokamaks include intrinsic modes of ELM free operation, ELM triggering with frequent small pellet injection and the application of 3D magnetic fields.},

abstract = {Recent experiments at JET combining reciprocating probe measurements upstream and infrared thermography at the plasma-facing components (PFC) on plasmas in limiter configurations showthat the common approach to predicting the power load on the limiter underestimates the heat flux at the contact point by a factor 1.5–3. The current model and scaling laws used for predicting the power load onto the first wall during limiter current ramp-up/down in ITER are uncertain and a better understanding of the heat transport to the PFCs is required. The heat loads on PFCs are usually predicted by projecting the parallel heat flux associated with scrape-off layer (SOL) properties at the outer mid-plane (upstream) along the magnetic field lines to the limiter surface and deducing the surface heat flux through a cosine law, thus ignoring any local effect of the PFC on transport within the SOL. The underestimate of the heat flux is systematic in inner wall limiter configurations, independent of the plasma parameters, whereas in outer limiter configuration this is not observed, probably because of the much shorter SOL power decay length. Models that can explain this enhanced heat flux around the contact point are proposed and discussed although no definitive conclusion can be drawn.},

The saturation process is energy transfer to self generated edge turbulence which exhibits an ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode structure. Convergence in the decay phase is found only if the spectrum reaches the ion gyroradius. The equilibrium is a self consistent background whose evolution is taken into account. Approximately two thirds of the total energy in the edge layer is liberated in the blowout. Parameter dependence with respect to plasma pressure and the ion gyroradius is studied.

The obtained dispersion relation reduces to that found from collisionless kinetic theory when the collision frequency is zero. Electron temperature fluctuations must be retained in the standard fluid analysis in order to obtain good quantitative agreement with our general solution in the highly collisional limit. Any discrepancies between the fluid solution and our general solution in this limit are attributed to the limitations of the BGK collision operator. The maximum growth rates in both the collisional and collisionless limits are comparable and are both on the order of the fundamental drift wave frequency. The main role of the destabilizing mechanism is found to be in determining the parallel wave number at which the maximum growth rate will occur. The parallel wave number corresponding to the maximum growth rate is set by the wave-particle resonance condition in the collisionless limit and transitions to being set by the real frequency being on the order of the rate for electrons to diffuse a parallel wavelength in the collisional limit.},

abstract = {In magnetically confined fusion experiments, turbulent transport dominates over collisional transport in the edge gradient region and in the scrape-off layer (SOL). Traditionally concepts as Fick's law are used to describe turbulent transport by effective diffusion coefficients and convective velocities. These concepts are only well founded if the transport exhibits Gaussian statistics. In the last decade it has become increasingly obvious this is not the case [E.T. Lu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 74 (1995) 2511; D. Newman, B.A. Carreras, P. Diamond, T.S. Hahm, Phys. Plasmas 3 (1996) 1858]. Intermittency, long range correlations, and ballistic transport events are widely documented in the plasma edge. The latter are characterized by the radial propagation of coherent structures - usually referred to as blobs - carrying energy, current and particle density across magnetic field lines. This ultimately renders the description of transport by mere use of effective mean transport coefficients useless, as this does not account for the effects of frequent extreme events, which have strong, lasting, and possibly destructive influence on plasma facing components. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Drift-Alfveacuten vortex filaments associated with electromagnetic turbulence were recently identified in reversed field pinch devices. Similar propagating filamentary structures were observed in the Earth magnetosheath, magnetospheric cusp and Saturn's magnetosheath by spacecrafts. The characteristics of these structures closely resemble those of the so-called mesoscale coherent structures, prevailing in fusion plasmas, known as "blobs" and "edge localized mode filaments" in the boundary region, and propagating avalanchelike events in the core region. In this paper the fundamental dynamics of drift-Alfveacuten vortex filaments in a nonuniformly and strongly magnetized plasma are revisited. We systemize the Lagrangian-invariant-based method. Six Lagrangian invariants are employed to describe structure motion and the resultant convective transport, namely, magnetic flux, background magnetic energy, specific entropy, total energy, magnetic momentum, and angular momentum. The perpendicular vortex motions and the kinetic shear Alfveacuten waves are coupled through the parallel current and Ampere's law, leading to field line bending. On the timescale of interchange motion tau(perpendicular to), a thermal expansion force in the direction of curvature radius of the magnetic field overcomes the resultant force of magnetic tension and push plasma filament to accelerate in the direction of curvature radius resulting from plasma inertial response, reacted to satisfy quasineutrality. During this process the internal energy stored in the background pressure gradient is converted into the kinetic energy of convective motion and the magnetic energy of field line bending through reversible pressure-volume work as a result of the plasma compressibility in an inhomogeneous magnetic field. On the timescale of parallel acoustic response tau(vertical bar vertical bar)tau(perpendicular to), part of the filament's energy is transferred into the kinetic energy of parallel flow. On the dissipation timescale tau(d)tau(perpendicular to), the kinetic energy and magnetic energy are eventually dissipated, which is accompanied by entropy production, and in this process the structure loses its coherence, but it has already traveled a distance in the radial direction. In this way the propagating filamentary structures induce intermittent convective transports of particles, heat, and momentum across the magnetic field. It is suggested that the phenomena of profile consistency, or resilience, and the underlying anomalous pinch effects of particles, heat, and momentum in the fusion plasmas can be interpreted in terms of the ballistic motion of these solitary electromagnetic filamentary structures.},

abstract = {The tokamak (a doughnut-shaped vacuum chamber surrounded by magnetic coils) is the principal tool in controlled fusion research. This book acts as an introduction to the subject and a basic reference for theory, definitions, equations, and experimental results. Since the first introductory account of tokamaks in 1987, when the tokamak had become the predominant device in the attempt to achieve a useful power source from thermonuclear fusion, and the developments and advances in the subject covered in the second edition in 1997, following substantial research on large tokamaks (the long awaited achievement of significant amounts of fusion power and the problems involved in designing and building a tokamak reactor), the emphasis has been on preparing the ground for an experimental reactor. In addition, there have been further significant advances in understanding plasma behaviour, such as the wider experience of internal transport barriers, the appreciation of the role of tearing models driven by neoclassical effects and insights from turbulence simulations. The fourth edition has been completely revised, bringing all aspects up-to-date and describing the development of tokamaks to the point of producing significant fusion power. It also now addresses the issues relating to the design and future operation of the international tokamak ITER.},

abstract = {A common feature of magnetized plasmas is the presence of fluctuations, which can lead to fully developed turbulence. Often large events--called bursts--emerge from the remaining low-level turbulence, giving an intermittent character to fluctuations; namely the statistical properties of fluctuations are found to depend on the temporal scale over which the investigation is conducted.In magnetized plasmas, the bursts are generally believed to be due to the presence of magnetic-field-aligned structures. Moreover, it has been experimentally shown that the intermittent events detected in the signals are associated with a relevant contribution to the loss of particles from the plasma.All these observations are common to plasmas spanning a wide range of temperature and density and magnetically confined both in linear and toroidal devices. In particular, in high-temperature plasmas for thermonuclear fusion, research aims at devising suitable ways to control transport by acting on the plasma structures, for instance by biasing the plasma edge using electrodes.This paper gives a characterization of the structures found in magnetized plasmas and of their contribution to the particle transport; moreover, the effect of the velocity shear on structures is addressed. Emphasis will be laid on to the most advanced diagnostics allowing the reconstruction of turbulent structures by optical and electrostatic techniques.},

TOKAM-3D is a 3D full-torus fluid code that can be used both in diffusive and turbulent regimes and covers either exclusively closed flux surfaces or both open and closed field lines in limiter geometry. Two independent mechanisms susceptible to lead to large amplitude asymmetric parallel flows are evidenced. Global ExB drifts coupled with the presence of the limiter break the poloidal symmetry and can generate large amplitude parallel flows even with poloidally uniform transport coefficients. On the other hand, turbulent transport in the edge exhibits a strong ballooning of the radial particle flux generating an up-down m = 1, n = 0 structure on the parallel velocity. The combination of both mechanisms in complete simulations leads to a poloidal and radial distribution of the parallel velocity comparable to experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These and other non-local electron heat transport conundra from recent experiments are reviewed. The models and physical processes advanced to explain these puzzling phenomena are also discussed.

abstract = {An energy-conserving set of the nonlinear electrostatic gyrokinetic Vlasov and Poisson equations is derived for the first time in the presence of equilibrium ExB velocity u(E) similar to v(Ti), via phase-space Lagrangian Lie-perturbation theory. In this general formulation, only the basic small parameter epsilon with w/Omega similar to k parallel to/k perpendicular to similar to epsilon and delta n/n(0) similar to 1/k perpendicular to L similar to epsilon, is used, while no device-specific expansion has been made. Here, L is the equilibrium scale length. For application to microturbulence in tokamak core transport barriers, an additional small ordering parameter delta(B)=B theta/B much less than 1 is utilized. This leads to a useful form of the nonlinear gyrokinetic system which is applicable to a realistic situation in which the gradient lengths of the equilibrium radial electric field and pressure are of the same order as the ion poloidal gyroradius. The ordering for fluctuations is also modified to delta n/n(0) similar to epsilon delta(B) much less than 1/k perpendicular to L similar to delta(B) for a better description of sub-mixing-length level fluctuations. U-E/V(Ti)similar to delta(B) and rho(theta i)similar to L(p) put the pressure-gradient contribution to E(r) and the toroidal-flow contribution to E(r) at the same order delta(B) similar to epsilon is shown to be a maximal ordering for studying the ExB flow shear suppression of turbulence.

These changes include a general decrease of coherence, an increase in the phase lag (between density and potential), and a straightening of the observed dispersion relation. Concomitantly, the intensifying and broadening fluctuation spectra lead to significant cross-field radial particle transport.

This is made feasible by full f formulation and by recording the charge density changes due to the ion polarization drift and electron acceleration along the local magnetic field while particles are advanced. The code has been validated against the linear predictions of the unstable ion temperature gradient mode growth rates and frequencies. Convergence and saturation in both turbulent and neoclassical limit of the ion heat conductivity is obtained with numerical noise well suppressed by a sufficiently large number of simulation particles. A first global full f validation of the neoclassical radial electric field in the presence of turbulence for a heated collisional tokamak plasma is obtained. At high Mach number (Mp∼ 1) of the poloidal flow, the radial electric field is significantly enhanced over the standard neoclassical prediction. The neoclassical radial electric field together with the related GAM oscillations is found to regulate the turbulent heat and particle diffusion levels particularly strongly in a large aspect ratio tokamak at low plasma current. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The flow shear profile is produced by a combination of the turbulent Reynold's stress inside the last closed surface and the sheath-induced flow in the SOL. The turbulent properties are studied as a function of zonal flow damping. The role of other edge and SOL dissipation mechanisms are also discussed.},

abstract = {A new type of particle simulation model based on the gyrophase-averaged Vlasov and Poisson equations is presented. The reduced system, in which particle gyrations are removed from the equations of motion while the finite Larmor radius effects are still preserved, is most suitable for studying low frequency microinstabilities in magnetized plasmas. The resulting gyrokinetic plasma is intrinsically quasineutral for ??D ??? ??{\{}variant{\}}s (?????{\{}variant{\}}i( Te Ti)1 2). Thus, without the troublesome space charge waves in the simulation, we can afford to use much larger time steps (??H ??t {\{}precedes above almost equal to{\}} 1) and grid spacings (??x???/??{\{}variant{\}}s {\{}precedes above almost equal to{\}} 1) at a much reduced noise level than we would have for conventional particle codes, where ??H???(k???/k???)(??D/??{\{}variant{\}}s)??pe, and k??? ??? k???. Furthermore, it is feasible to simulate an elongated system (L??? ??? L???) with a three-dimensional grid using the present model without resorting to the usual mode expansion technique, since there is essentially no restriction on the size of ??x??? in a gyrokinetic plasma. The new approach also enables us to further separate the time and spatial scales of the simulation from those associated with global transport through the use of multiple spatial scale expansion. Thus, the model can be a very efficient tool for studying anomalous transport problems related to steady-state drift-wave turbulence in magnetic confinement devices. It can also be applied to other areas of plasma physics. ?? 1987.},

As a consequence, recycling onto the main-chamber walls is large compared to plasma flows into the divertor volume. The SOL exhibits a two-layer structure: Steep gradients and moderate fluctuation levels are typically found in a ∼5 mm region near the separatrix (near SOL) where parallel electron conduction typically dominates energy losses. Small gradients and larger fluctuation levels with longer correlation times are found outside this region (far SOL). D eff in the near SOL increases strongly with local plasma collisionality normalized to the magnetic connection length. As the discharge density limit is approached, D eff and associated fluctuation levels become large across the entire SOL and cross-field heat convection everywhere exceeds parallel conduction losses, impacting the power balance of the discharge.},

These properties lead to new formulae for the Legendre polynomials and their derivatives in terms of cartesian tensors. The traceless cartesian tensor forms are used to treat problems in electrostatics of a dielectric medium requiring spherical harmonic expansions of the potential. These include the potentials arising from an arbitrary charge distribution in a spherical dielectric cavity, the reaction field gradients in the cavity, the response of a dielectric sphere embedded in a dielectric medium to an arbitrary external field, and the gradients of the Lorentz internal field in a homogeneous dielectric.

Focusing on the drift-wave instability, we show that our framework allows retrieving established collisional and collisionless limits. At the intermediate collisionalities relevant for present and future magnetic nuclear fusion devices, deviations with respect to collision operators used in state-of-the-art turbulence simulation codes show the need for retaining the full Coulomb operator in order to obtain both the correct instability growth rate and eigenmode spectrum, which, for example, may significantly impact quantitative predictions of transport.

abstract = {A theory of electron oscillations of an unbounded plasma of uniform ion density is developed, taking into account the effects of random thermal motions, but neglecting collisions.The first problem considered is that of finding the frequencies at which a plasma can undergo organized steady-state oscillations of small enough amplitude so that a linear approximation applies. It is found that long wave-length oscillations of plasmas with a Maxwell distribution of electron velocities are characterized by the steady-state dispersion relation $\omega$2=$\omega$P2+(3$\kappa$T/m)(2$\pi$/$\lambda$)2. Here $\omega$P is the plasma frequency, T the absolute temperature of the electron gas, $\lambda$ the wave-length, and $\omega$ the angular frequency of oscillation. It is also shown that organized oscillations of wave-lengths smaller than the Debye length for the electron gas are not possible.The theory is then extended to describe the processes by which oscillations are set up. It is found that, for a given wave-length, a plasma can oscillate with arbitrary frequency, but that those frequencies not given by the steady-state dispersion relation describe motions in which, after some time, there is no contribution to macroscopic averages. These additional frequencies lead asymptotically only to microscopic fluctuations of the charge density about the organized oscillation of the plasma. In this way, one can describe the manner in which the system develops organized behavior.The treatment is then applied to large steady-state oscillations for which the equations are non-linear. One obtains solutions in which particles close to the wave velocity are trapped in the trough of the potential, oscillating back and forth about a mean velocity equal to that of the wave. One can also obtain non-linear traveling pulse solutions in which a group of particles, moving as a pulse, creates a reaction on the surrounding charge, which traps the particles and holds them together.},

Somewhat surprisingly, and unlike in the analogous case of ion-temperature-gradient-driven (ITG)turbulence, we find that the turbulent electron heat flux is significantly underpredicted by simple mixing length estimates in a certain parameter regime (ŝ∼1, low $\alpha$). This observation is directly linked to the presence of radially highly elongated vortices (“streamers”) which lead to very effective cross-field transport.

abstract = {The linear behavior of resistive ballooning modes in the edge and scrape-off layer of diverted tokamaks is explored in the context of a collisional fluid model. It is shown that the large magnetic shear and small poloidal field in the X-point region act to increase the wave number, and hence the importance of resistivity, near the X point. The resulting “disconnection” of the eigenmodes across the X point profoundly influences the unstable spectrum. A new class of modes called resistive X-point (RX) modes exploits this synergism between resistivity and the X-point geometry, giving rise to robust growth rates at moderate-to-low mode numbers. Relative to an equivalent limited plasma, the diverted plasma is shown to be more unstable in the edge (inside the separatrix), and more stable in the scrape-off layer.},

abstract = {The relativistic equilibrium velocity distribution plays a key role in describing several high-energy and astrophysical effects. Recently, computer simulations favored J{\"{u}}ttner's as the relativistic generalization of Maxwell's distribution for d=1,2,3 spatial dimensions and pointed to an invariant temperature. In this work, we argue an invariant temperature naturally follows from manifest covariance. We present a derivation of the manifestly covariant J{\"{u}}ttner's distribution and equipartition theorem. The standard procedure to get the equilibrium distribution as a solution of the relativistic Boltzmann's equation, which holds for dilute gases, is here adopted. However, contrary to previous analysis, we use Cartesian coordinates in d+1 momentum space, with d spatial components. The use of the multiplication theorem of Bessel functions turns crucial to regain the known invariant form of J{\"{u}}ttner's distribution. Since equilibrium kinetic-theory results should agree with thermodynamics in the comoving frame to the gas the covariant pseudonorm of a vector entering the distribution can be identified with the reciprocal of temperature in such comoving frame. Then by combining the covariant statistical moments of J{\"{u}}ttner's distribution a form of the equipartition theorem is advanced which also accommodates the invariant comoving temperature and it contains, as a particular case, a previous not manifestly covariant form.},

abstract = {This book presents the science of tensors in a didactic way. The various types and ranks of tensors and the physical basis is presented. Cartesian Tensors are needed for the description of directional phenomena in many branches of physics and for the characterization the anisotropy of material properties. The first sections of the book provide an introduction to the vector and tensor algebra and analysis, with applications to physics, at undergraduate level. Second rank tensors, in particular their symmetries, are discussed in detail. Differentiation and integration of fields, including generalizations of the Stokes law and the Gauss theorem, are treated. The physics relevant for the applications in mechanics, quantum mechanics, electrodynamics and hydrodynamics is presented. The second part of the book is devoted to tensors of any rank, at graduate level. Special topics are irreducible, i.e. symmetric traceless tensors, isotropic tensors, multipole potential tensors, spin tensors, integration and spin-trace formulas, coupling of irreducible tensors, rotation of tensors. Constitutive laws for optical, elastic and viscous properties of anisotropic media are dealt with. The anisotropic media include crystals, liquid crystals and isotropic fluids, rendered anisotropic by external orienting fields. The dynamics of tensors deals with phenomena of current research. In the last section, the 3D Maxwell equations are reformulated in their 4D version, in accord with special relativity.},

abstract = {In recent years, the basic physics picture of plasma transport in the scrape-off layers of tokamaks and stellarators has changed. This basic picture was based on slow diffusive cross-field transport competing with fast parallel transport. However, the idea of a local diffusive cross-field transport picture is not compatible with some of the experimental findings. Cross-field particle fluxes have an intermittent character. Large transport events can be responsible for a large portion of the total integrated flux. Those measurements also show the existence of long-range correlations in time and space. These correlations break down a possible separation of scales that was the base in deriving the macroscopic transport models. Structures are not limited to density fluctuations; they also appear on edge flows. The interaction between fluctuations and flows becomes one of the most important issues in the plasma edge dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The procedure provides new insights into the limitations of the gyrokinetic quasineutrality equation. We find that the ion distribution function must be known at least to second order in gyroradius over characteristic length to calculate the long wavelength components of the electrostatic potential self-consistently. Moreover, using the example of a steady-state $\theta$-pinch, we prove that the quasineutrality equation fails to provide the axisymmetric piece of the potential even with a distribution function correct to second order. We also show that second order accuracy is enough if a more convenient moment equation is used instead of the quasineutrality equation. These results indicate that the gyrokinetic quasineutrality equation is not the most effective procedure to find the electrostatic potential if the long wavelength components are to be retained in the analysis.},

Collisions are modeled via a Lenard-Bernstein collision operator which fundamentally alters the linear spectrum even for infinitesimal collisionality [Ng et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 1974 (1999)]. A comparison between different discretization schemes reveals that a Hermite representation is superior for accurately resolving the spectra compared to a finite differences scheme using an equidistant velocity grid. Additionally, it is shown analytically that any even power of velocity space hyperdiffusion also produces a Case-Van Kampen spectrum which, in the limit of zero hyperdiffusivity, matches the collisionless Landau solutions.

With a poloidal probe array, consisting of 128 Langmuir probes, density and potential fluctuations are measured on four neighboring flux surfaces simultaneously over the complete poloidal circumference. By analyzing Reynolds stress and pseudo-Reynolds stress, it is found that, for increasing collisionality, the coupling between density and potential decreases which hinders the zonal flow drive. Also, as a consequence, the nonlinear energy transfer, as well as the zonal flow contribution to the complete turbulent spectrum, decreases the same way. This is in line with theoretical expectations and is a first experimental verification of the importance of collisionality for large-scale structure formation in magnetically confined toroidal plasmas.},

abstract = {Suppose that one solution of the ``Webster'' equation for any given horn is known, valid for particular boundary conditions and at one frequency. Expressions for the other linearly independent solution and for the derivatives of both solutions with respect to frequency are deduced and given in computable form. This allows the behavior of the horn for any loading, and in a wide range of frequencies, to be derived from a solution with one loading, at one frequency. The originally known solution may be computed, or experimental, or it may be the initial wavefunction in the inverse method of horn design (where the horn contour is derived from the initial wavefunction, which is constructed to satisfy the design requirements). With the new results, it is straightforward to compute the behavior of horns that were designed by the inverse method (for example, the ``Terminated Gaussian'' and the ``Fourier'') in conditions not envisaged in their design. Further, the inverse method can now be used to design new horns with specified characteristics at a number of loads (including dissipative toads) and frequencies. The impedances of horns are discussed in the light of the relation between the solutions of Webster's equation, with special reference to the ideal transformer. The general impedance relations are thereby considerably simplified. Some basic results of the theory of horns are briefly reviewed and an annotated bibliography of over 200 references is given. Attention is drawn to very important work on the horn equation and its solution--long before Webster--in particular to brilliant papers by Daniel Bernoulli, by Lagrange, and by Euler in the 18th century.},

Filament velocities in this region are ???3x faster than the radial velocities at the midplane, in a direction roughly outward across the local flux surfaces. The observations are consistent with the picture that the filaments arise in the outboard region and, as a consequence of the rapid parallel diffusion of the potential perturbations, map along field lines.

abstract = {Fluidlike models have long been used to develop qualitative understanding of the drift-wave class of instabilities (such as the ion temperature gradient mode and various trapped-particle modes) which are prime candidates for explaining anomalous transport in plasmas. Here, the fluid approach is improved by developing fairly realistic models of kinetic effects, such as Landau damping and gyroradius orbit averaging, which strongly affect both the linear mode properties and the resulting nonlinear turbulence. Central to this work is a simple but effective fluid model [Phys. Rev. Lett. 64, 3019 (1990)] of the collisionless phase mixing responsible for Landau damping (and inverse Landau damping). This model is based on a nonlocal damping term with a damping rate approximately v(t)$\backslash$k(parallel-to)$\backslash$ in the closure approximation for the nth velocity space moment of the distribution function f, resulting in an n-pole approximation of the plasma dispersion function Z. Alternatively, this closure approximation is linearly exact (and therefore physically realizable) for a particular f0 which is close to Maxwellian. "Gyrofluid" equations (conservation laws for the guiding-center density n, momentum mnu(parallel-to), and parallel and perpendicular pressures p(parallel-to) and p(perpendicular-to)) are derived by taking moments of the gyrokinetic equation in guiding-center coordinates rather than particle coordinates. This naturally yields nonlinear gyroradius terms and an important gyroaveraging of the shear. The gyroradius effects in the Bessel functions are modeled with robust Pade-like approximations. These new fluid models of phase mixing and Landau damping are being applied by others to a broad range of applications outside of drift-wave turbulence, including strong Langmuir turbulence, laser-plasma interactions, and the alpha-driven toroidicity-induced Alfven eigenmode (TAE) instability.},

abstract = {Fundamentals of Plasma Physics is a comprehensive textbook designed to present a logical and unified treatment of the fundamentals of plasma physics based on statistical kinetic theory, with applications to a variety of important plasma phenomena. The clarity and completeness of the text makes it suitable for self-learning. Throughout the text the emphasis is on clarity, rather than formality. The various derivations are explained in detail and, wherever possible, the physical interpretations are emphasized. The mathematical treatment is set out in great detail, carrying out steps that are usually left to the reader. The problems form an integral part of the text and most of them were designed in such a way as to provide a guideline for the student, stating intermediate steps with answers. The book is intended primarily for advanced undergraduate and first year graduate students meeting the subject of plasma physics for the first time and is suitable for those who have taken classical mechanics, electrodynamics and mathematics beyond sophomore level. It is a valuable compendium for any serious student of plasma physics at the level of research student or research worker and it is also of interest to researchers in other related fields, such as space physics and applied electromagnetism.},

@article{Balbus1998,
abstract = {Recent years have witnessed dramatic progress in our understanding of how turbulence arises and transports angular momentum in astrophysical accretion disks. The key conceptual point has its origins in work dating from the 1950s, but its implications have been fully understood only in the last several years: the combination of a subthermal magnetic field (any nonpathological configuration will do) and outwardly decreasing differential rotation rapidly generates magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence via a remarkably simple linear instability. The result is a greatly enhanced effective viscosity, the origin of which had been a long-standing problem. The MHD nature of disk turbulence has linked two broad domains of magnetized fluid research: accretion theory and dynamos. The understanding that weak magnetic fields are not merely passively acted upon by turbulence, but actively generate it, means that the assumptions of classical dynamo theory break down in disks. Paralleling the new conceptual understanding has been the development of powerful numerical MHD codes. These have taught us that disks truly are turbulent, transporting angular momentum at greatly enhanced rates. We have also learned, however, that not all forms of disk turbulence do this. Purely hydrodynamic turbulence, when it is imposed, simply causes fluctuations without a significant increase in transport. The interplay between numerical simulation and analytic arguments has been particularly fruitful in accretion disk theory and is a major focus of this article. The authors conclude with a summary of what is now known of disk turbulence and mention some knotty outstanding questions (e.g., what is the physics behind nonlinear field saturation?) for which we may soon begin to develop answers.},

These modes exist at the same spatial scales as the unstable eigenmodes that drive the turbulence. The larger amplitude subdominant modes are weakly damped and exhibit smooth, large-scale structure in velocity space and in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. Modes with increasingly fine-scale structure are excited to decreasing amplitudes. In aggregate, damped modes define a potent energy sink. This leads to an overlap of the spatial scales of energy injection and peak dissipation, a feature that is in contrast with more traditional turbulent systems.},

The fluid moment hierarchy is closed by approximating the gyrokinetic distribution function as a finite order Hermite-Laguerre polynomial and by determining closure approximations for terms involving the gyrokinetic gyro-averaging operator. The model exactly conserves the gyrokinetic full-F energy invariant evaluated using the Hermite-Laguerre decomposition.

This kind of re-scaling holds at different timescales in which the functional form of the PDF changes. The empirical similarity in the PDF of turbulent transport in the edge region in both the JET tokamak and the TJ-II stellarator supports the view that turbulent transport displays universality in fusion plasmas.

abstract = {The problem in identifying the sites of origin of Galactic Cosmic Rays (CRs) is reviewed. Recent observational evidence from very-high energy (VHE, energies above 100 GeV) gamma-ray measurements is in contradiction with the surmise that synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons is indicative for hadron acceleration. It rather points to a CR-acceleration efficiency of supernova remnants (SNRs) below one percent, much less than the value required if these objects were to be the main sources of Galactic cosmic rays (about 30{\%}). Observations of CR anisotropy and the emission of low-energy (energy {\textless} 10 GeV) gamma-rays from the Galactic disk indicate that the sources of low-energy cosmic rays are distributed with a Galactocentric radial scale length in the order of 25 +- 10 kpc, much larger than expected if SNRs are the main sources of CRs. These two facts - together with the body of evidence from CR isotope abundances - strongly suggest that a new class of astrophysical objects - distinct from SNRs and located manly in the outer reaches of our Galaxy - is the major source of hadronic CRs in our Galaxy. The basic observational features of ultra high-energy (UHE, energy {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}{\{}19{\}} eV) CRs are most naturally understood if the same CR sources accelerate CRs up to the highest observed CR energies. Proposals for the nature of a new source class are mentioned. The origin of CRs is still as much shrouded in mystery as it was in 1957, when Philip Morrison wrote a seminal review about CR origin. The potential for discoveries is thus great.},

However, it can be shown that Webster did not draw a full analogy with the electromagnetic potential, the potential energy per unit charge. This paper shows that the analogous "acoustical potential" the potential energy per unit displacement of fluid, corresponds to the wave function Psi of the reduced Webster equation, which is of Klein-Gordon form. The wave function is found to obey all of Dirichlet, Von Neumann, and mixed (Robins) boundary conditions, and the latter give rise to resonance phenomena that are not elucidated by Webster's analysis. It is shown that the exact Heaviside analogy yields a complete analytic account of the one-dimensional input impedance, that accounts for both plane- and dispersive-wave propagation both at the origin and throughout the duct.},

abstract = {Although diagnostics are the essential tools of the experimental plasma physicist, there are surprisingly few up-to-date books in this field. Several excellent volumes appeared in the early days of fusion research but these, though containing much material that is still relevant, are now seriously out of date with respect to the substantial advances that have taken place in this field over the past decades. There is of course a vast amount of information in journal articles, conference papers and reviews, but these generally are aimed at the experienced specialist and consequently usually omit, or at most give a quick overview of, the basic principles. Moreover most research papers are concerned either with recent developments or with specific applications of existing techniques making it difficult for a newcomer to the field to find a good introduction to the basic principles. So when the first edition of Ian Hutchinson's book entitled Principles of Plasma Diagnostics appeared some 15 years ago it filled an important niche and quickly established a high reputation. This book deals with the fundamental physics of plasma diagnostics and develops an understanding of the methods from first principles. Instrumentation and experimental techniques are not discussed in great detail-as the author explains, to do so would have resulted in an unwieldy volume and moreover some of the technology is developing so rapidly that it would soon become outdated-but there is sufficient discussion of the applications to guide the reader towards more specialist literature. So this is not a book that will give a step-by-step account of how to build or operate a diagnostic-but it is the place to turn to in order to learn about the physics underlying the measurement method. After a brief introduction, the book deals comprehensively with the broad range of diagnostic methods, categorising them according to the physical process or property of the plasma that is used in the measurement. Successive chapters deal with magnetic measurements; plasma particle flux measurements-essentially probe techniques; refractive index methods, including interferometry, polarimetry and reflectometry; emission from free electrons-cyclotron emission, bremsstrahlung etc.; emission from bound electrons-the classic emission spectroscopy; scattering of electromagnetic radiation, incoherent and coherent Thomson scattering; neutral atom diagnostics; and finally a chapter on fast ions and fusion products. There are appendices dealing with various mathematical tools and some special issues, a glossary of symbols and a list of references. And as well as these specific references, the author gives suggestions for further reading and exercises for the student at the end of each chapter. With over 25 years experience in experimental plasma physics, Ian Hutchinson has made significant contributions to the development of the physics of many of the measurement methods that are described here, so this is book of considerable authority and insight. It is well written and will provide much interesting reading for the experienced physicist as well as the student. The material has been thoroughly revised and updated for this second edition, with new sections and chapters covering recent developments in the field. A small amount of outdated material has been removed, but some additional hundred pages compared to the first edition have extended the work quite considerably. Although the book is based quite firmly on diagnostics for magnetic confinement fusion plasmas, the author's own field of research, the basic principles of these methods are sufficiently general and they are so well explained here that this book will serve as a valuable asset also for physicists working in other areas of plasma research-in particular astrophysical and processing plasmas. The treatment is generally at graduate student level; knowledge of basic plasma physics is useful but not essential to work through the book. But this is much more than a book for the student-it is a valuable work of reference that merits a place on every diagnostician's desk. Peter Stott},

abstract = {A new hybrid kinetic electron model is developed for electrostatic full-f gyrokinetic simulations of the ion temperature gradient driven trapped electron mode (ITG-TEM) turbulence at the ion scale. In the model, a full kinetic electron model is applied to the full-f gyrokinetic equation, the multi-species linear Fokker-Planck collision operator, and an axisymmetric part of the gyrokinetic Poisson equation, while in a non-axisymmetric part of the gyrokinetic Poisson equation, turbulent fluctuations are determined only by kinetic trapped electrons responses. By using this approach, the so-called $\omega$H mode is avoided with keeping important physics such as the ITG-TEM, the neoclassical transport, the ambipolar condition, and particle trapping and detrapping processes. The model enables full-f gyrokinetic simulations of ITG-TEM turbulence with a reasonable computational cost. Comparisons between flux driven ITG turbulence simulations with kinetic and adiabatic electrons are presented. Although the similar ion temperature gradients with nonlinear upshift from linear critical gradients are sustained in quasi-steady states, parallel flows and radial electric fields are qualitatively different with kinetic electrons.},

abstract = {The precise mathematical relation that the Hilbert and Chapman‐Enskog expansions bear to the manifold of solutions of the Boltzmann equation is described. These expansions yield inherently imprecise descriptions of a gas in terms of macroscopic fluid variables instead of a molecular distribution function. It is shown that these expansions are asymptotic to a very special class of solutions of the Boltzmann equation for sufficiently small mean free path. Next, a generalization of the Hilbert and Chapman‐Enskog expansions is described in terms of extended sets of macroscopic state variables, each governed by partial differential equations similar to those found in fluid dynamics, but sufficiently general to approximate an arbitrary distribution function. The generalized expansions are shown to be asymptotic to quite arbitrary solutions of the Boltzmann equation. It is then shown that the ordinary Hilbert and Chapman‐Enskog expansions can also be made asymptotic to very general solutions of the Boltzmann equation by reinterpreting the variables that enter these expansions as certain well‐defined replacements for the actual fluid state of the gas. In this way the scope of the Euler, Navier‐Stokes, Burnett equations, etc., is greatly extended by interpreting them as governing the artificial variables. Not only are general solutions of the Boltzmann equation shown to be approximated by fluid dynamics (in the limit of small mean free path), but the rapid decay of an arbitrary initial distribution function to a special Hilbert distribution function is also governed by sets of partial differential equations similar to those found in fluid dynamics.},

These fluctuations contribute a significant fraction to the 'anomalous' radial particle transport in the scrape-off layer (SOL). The basic properties and the dependence of the fluctuation parameters on the discharge conditions are documented. A model for an instability mechanism specific to the SOL is introduced and the experimentally observed fluctuation parameters are compared with the predictions of the Linearized version of this model. For plasma temperatures above similar to 10eV in the SOL the observed parameter dependences of the fluctuations are well reproduced by the model. By mixing length arguments the radial transport and the resulting density and pressure gradients in the SOL are estimated from the model. Their dependence on plasma temperature and density qualitatively agrees with the behaviour observed in ohmic discharges on ASDEX.},

The principal model presented includes evolution equations for the guiding center n, u(parallel-to), T(parallel-to), and T(perpendicular-to) along with an equation expressing the quasineutrality constraint. Additional evolution equations for higher moments are derived that may be used if greater accuracy is desired. The moment hierarchy is closed with a Landau damping model [G. W. Hammett and F. W. Perkins, Phys. Rev. Lett. 64, 3019 (1990)], which is equivalent to a multipole approximation to the plasma dispersion function, extended to include finite Larmor radius effects (FLR). In particular, new dissipative, nonlinear terms are found that model the perpendicular phase mixing of the distribution function along contours of constant electrostatic potential. These ''FLR phase-mixing'' terms introduce a hyperviscositylike damping is-proportional-to k(perpendicular-to)2 $\backslash$PHI(k)k x k'$\backslash$, which should provide a physics-based damping mechanism at high k(perpendicular-to) rho which is potentially as important as the usual polarization drift nonlinearity. The moments are taken in guiding center space to pick up the correct nonlinear FLR terms and the gyroaveraging of the shear. The equations are solved with a nonlinear, three-dimensional initial value code. Linear results are presented, showing excellent agreement with linear gyrokinetic theory.},

Universal aspects of the theory are emphasised. Two main astrophysical applications are touched upon: turbulence in the solar wind and in clusters of galaxies.

The L to H transition trigger is V×B rotation, not the main ion pressure gradient. The radial electric field Er shear increases before the fluctuation suppression, consistent with increasing Er shear as the cause of the turbulence suppression. The spatial dependence of the turbulence reduction is consistent with shear suppression for negative Er shear. For positive Er shear, the turbulence suppression is consistent with the effect of Er curvature for modes for which an Er well is destabilizing. Finally, the transport barrier depends on the phase angle between the density and potential fluctuations inside the Er well, an effect not included in existing L to H transition models.},

abstract = {The contribution to the Fokker-Planck equation for the distribution function for gases, due to particle-particle interactions in which the fundamental two-body force obeys an inverse square law, is investigated. The coefficients in the equation, 〈$\Delta$v〉 (the average change in velocity in a short time) and 〈$\Delta$v$\Delta$v〉, are obtained in terms of two fundamental integrals which are dependent on the distribution function itself. The transformation of the equation to polar coordinates in a case of axial symmetry is carried out. By expanding the distribution function in Legendre functions of the angle, the equation is cast into the form of an infinite set of one-dimensional coupled nonlinear integro-differential equations. If the distribution function is approximated by a finite series, the resultant Fokker-Planck equations may be treated numerically using a computing machine. Keeping only one or two terms in the series corresponds to the approximations of Chandrasekhar, and Cohen, Spitzer and McRoutly, respectively.},

abstract = {This is a review of what is known about fluctuations and anomalous transport processes in tokamaks. It mostly considers experimental results obtained after, and not included in, the reviews of Liewer [Nucl. Fusion 25, 543 (1985)], Robinson [in Turbulence and Anomalous Transport in Magnetized Plasmas (Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France, 1986), p. 21], and Surko [in Turbulence and Anomalous Transport in Magnetized Plasmas (Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France, 1986), p. 93]. Therefore much of the pioneering work in the field is not covered. Emphasis is placed on results where comparisons between fluctuations and transport properties have been attempted, particularly from the tokamak TEXT [Nucl. Technol./Fusion 1, 479 (1981)]. A brief comparison of experimentally measured total fluxes with the predictions of neoclassical theory demonstrates that transport is often anomalous; fluctuations are thought to be the cause.The measurements necessary to determine any such fluctuation‐driven fluxes are described. The diagnostics used to measure these quantities, together with some of the statistical techniques employed to analyze the data, are outlined. In the plasma edge detailed measurements of the quantities required to directly determine the fluctuation‐driven fluxes are available. The total and fluctuation‐driven fluxes are compared: the result emphasizes the importance of edge turbulence. No model adequately describes all the measured properties. In the confinement region experimental observations are presently restricted to measurements of density and potential fluctuations and their correlations. Various distinct turbulence features that have been observed are described, and their characteristics compared with the predictions of various models. Correlations observed between these fluctuations and plasma transport properties are summarized. A separate section on magnetic fluctuations shows there is very little information available inside the plasma, generally prohibiting quantified comparisons between fluctuation levels and transport. Both coherent and turbulent magnetic fluctuations are addressed, and the differences between low and high plasma pressure (low and high beta) are noted. The contributions of alternate confinement devices, such as stellarators and reversed field pinches, to understanding tokamak anomalous transport are discussed. Finally, future directions are proposed.},

More specifically, it re-expresses the equations of curved-spacetime electrodynamics in terms of a 3 + 1 (space + time) split, in which the key quantities are three-dimensional vectors (electric field E, magnetic field B etc.) that lie in hypersurfaces of constant time t. Three-dimensional vector analysis is used to express Maxwell's equations, the Gauss, Faraday and Ampere laws, the Lorentz force law, and the laws of energy and momentum conservation in forms closely resembling their flat-spacetime counterparts. After developing the 3 + 1 formalism for general spacetimes, this paper specializes to the spacetime outside a stationary but rotating black hole. The Znajek-Damour boundary conditions at the hole's horizon are re-expressed in 3 + 1 language. Because the black hole's hypersurfaces of constant time all have identical three-dimensional geometries, one can abandon entirely Einstein's view of spacetime and return to Galileo's: The electric and magnetic fields E and B can be regarded as living in an absolute (but curved) three-dimensional space, and as evolving in this space with the passage of universal time t. This viewpoint and associated mathematics are the foundation for the companion paper.},

The damping phenomenon is reinterpreted in terms of transfer of regularity between kinetic and spatial variables, rather than exchanges of energy; phase mixing is the driving mechanism. The analysis involves new families of analytic norms, measuring regularity by comparison with solutions of the free transport equation; new functional inequalities; a control of nonlinear echoes; sharp scattering estimates; and a Newton approximation scheme. Our results hold for any potential no more singular than Coulomb or Newton interaction; the limit cases are included with specific technical effort. As a side result, the stability of homogeneous equilibria of the nonlinear Vlasov equation is established under sharp assumptions. We point out the strong analogy with the KAM theory, and discuss physical implications.},

Numerical analyses of bifurcation phenomena in the model are presented, that provide new insights into the interactions between turbulence and zonal flows in the tokamak plasma edge region. The simulation results show a regime where, after an initial transient, drift wave turbulence is suppressed through zonal flow generation. As a parameter controlling the strength of the turbulence is tuned, this zonal-flow-dominated state is rapidly destroyed and a turbulence-dominated state re-emerges. The transition is explained in terms of the Kelvin-Helmholtz stability of zonal flows. This is the first observation of an upshift of turbulence onset in the resistive drift wave system, which is analogous to the well-known Dimits shift in turbulence driven by ion temperature gradients.},

abstract = {We describe a new approach to solve the electromagnetic gyrokinetic equations which is optimized for accurate treatment of multispecies Fokker–Planck collisions including both pitch-angle and energy diffusion. The new algorithm is spectral/pseudospectral in four of the five phase space dimensions, and in the fieldline direction a novel 5th-order conservative upwind scheme is used to permit high-accuracy electromagnetic simulation even in the limit of very high plasma $\beta$ and vanishingly small perpendicular wavenumber, k⊥→0. To our knowledge, this is the first pseudospectral implementation of the collision operator in a gyrokinetic code. We show that the new solver agrees closely with GYRO in the limit of weak Lorentz collisions, but gives a significantly more realistic description of collisions at high collision frequency. The numerical methods are also designed to be efficient and scalable for multiscale simulations that treat ion-scale and electron–scale turbulence simultaneously.},

abstract = {Drift wave turbulence, in general a balance between E x B drift turbulence in planes perpendicular to, and dissipative wave dynamics parallel to, a background magnetic field, is a hallmark example of nonlinearity in plasma physics. The turbulence generally has the same basic character in a sheared magnetic field lying in closed surfaces whether linear instabilities are present or not. Only when the linear forcing terms are dominant does this situation not prevail; it is not analogous to neutral fluid turbulence where pure linear forcing is balanced by pure nonlinear mixing and decorrelation. Detailed computations show that two types of nonlinearity are simultaneously present: advection of fluid vorticity by the E x B flows, which tends to have a scattering character, and E x B advection of pressure disturbances, which has the familiar diffusive mixing character. The vorticity nonlinearity excites the turbulence, acting against the mostly linear parallel dynamics which constrains it, while the pressure nonlinearity provides dissipation via transfer to ever smaller scales. The practical result is that the saturated level of the turbulence and the resulting averaged thermal energy transport are controlled principally by these nonlinear mechanisms even when moderate linear instabilities are present. The model is mostly applicable to tokamak edge turbulence, for which the linear forcing effects are sufficiently moderate that the nonlinear physics is allowed to operate.},

We show the system reduces to the Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime in general, spherically symmetric coordinates in the vacuum limit. Furthermore, we show reduction to the charged Vaidya spacetime in non-null coordinates when certain equations of states are chosen. A model of gravitational collapse is discussed whereby a charged fluid resides within a boundary of finite radial extent on the initial hypersurface, and is allowed to radiate charged particles. Our formalism allows for the discussion of all regions in this model without the need for complicated matching schemes at the interfaces between successive regions. As further examples we consider the collapse of a thin shell of charged matter onto a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. Finally, we reduce the entire system of equations to the static case such that we have the equations for hydrostatic equilibrium of a charged fluid.},

abstract = {A blob-filament (or simply “blob”) is a magnetic-field-aligned plasma structure which is considerably denser than the surrounding background plasma and highly localized in the directions perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field B. In experiments and simulations, these intermittent filaments are often formed near the boundary between open and closed field lines, and seem to arise in theory from the saturation process for the dominant edge instabilities and turbulence. Blobs become charge-polarized under the action of an external force which causes unequal drifts on ions and electrons; the resulting polarization-induced E × B drift moves the blobs radially outwards across the scrape-off-layer (SOL). Since confined plasmas generally are subject to radial or outwards expansion forces (e.g., curvature and ∇B forces in toroidal plasmas), blob transport is a general phenomenon occurring in nearly all plasmas. This paper reviews the relationship between the experimental and theoretical results on blob formation, dynamics and transport and assesses the degree to which blob theory and simulations can be compared and validated against experiments. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics},

The present work uses Dirac's recent theory, in which the spin effects grow more naturally from the fundamental equations. Calculations which are in dependent of the spin, such as the approximate energy-levels and the ortho-para separations, are the same on either theory. We deal here with spin effects, such as the fine structure of the triplets and intercombinations between ortho- and para- states. The fundamental equations, the perturbation theory which is used, and the perturbing spin energy, have been discussed fully elsewhere. The present paper, after a short recapitulation of the general theory, gives in detail the calculations whose results alone were quoted in the other. {\S}{\S} 4–7 work out the structure of the helium triplets with one excited election.

The explicit calculation of Rosenbluth potentials converts the integro-differential form of the Coulomb collision operator into a differential operator, which enables one to express the collision operator in a simple closed form for any arbitrary mass and temperature ratios. In addition, it is shown that gyrophase averaging the collision operator acting on arbitrary distribution functions is the same as the collision operator acting on the corresponding gyrophase averaged distribution functions. The moments of the collision operator are linear combinations of the fluid moments with collision coefficients parametrized by mass and temperature ratios. Useful forms involving the small mass-ratio approximation are easily found since the collision operators and their moments are expressed in terms of the mass ratio. As an application, the general moment equations are explicitly written and the higher order heat flux equation is derived.},

abstract = {Recent experiments have led to a fundamental shift in our view of edge transport physics; transport near the last-closed flux surface may be more appropriately described in terms of a critical gradient phenomenon rather than a diffusive and/or convective paradigm. Edge pressure gradients, normalized by the square of the poloidal magnetic field strength, appear invariant in plasmas with the same normalized collisionality, despite vastly different currents and magnetic fields—a behavior that connects with first-principles electromagnetic plasma turbulence simulations. Near-sonic scrape-off layer (SOL) flows impose a cocurrent rotation boundary condition on the confined plasma when B × ∇ B points toward the active x-point, suggesting a link to the concomitant reduction in input power needed to attain high-confinement modes. Indeed, low-confinement mode plasmas are found to attain higher edge pressure gradients in this configuration, independent of the direction of B , evidence that SOL flows may affect transport and “critical gradient” values in the edge plasma.},

abstract = {Controlled thermonuclear fusion is a promising possibility as a novel energy source in the worldwide context of a continuously increasing demand for energy. A key element in the success of this technology is the understanding of the physical processes occurring at the plasma-wall interface and, in particular, in the Scrape-off Layer (SOL), the region of the plasma that is responsible for the plasma confinement, the heat exhaust and the impurity level regulation. In this framework, a reduced drift-kinetic model that introduces a moment hierarchy describing the parallel and perpendicular moments of the distribution function was proposed for a description of the SOL that includes both the kinetic and the fluid models as its limits. The first purpose of the present thesis work is to linearise the reduced drift-kinetic model and to provide a rigorous derivation of the linear kinetic effects. In particular a general linearised conservation equation, which is able to describe different kinds of phenomena, was obtained. The second purpose is to accurately investigate two of these effects. First, the analysis of Landau damping, through a Van Kampen approach, allowed to recover the results known in literature. Moreover, the convergence of the least damped solutions was studied and these solutions were proven to be converging to the Landau root. Second, the analysis of drift waves was carried out within the fluid approximation, recovering once again the results known in literature. Finally, a kinetic study was performed, that demonstrated the influence of kinetic effects on the drift wave instability, by evolving a reduced number of extra moments of the distribution function. The method presented here provides a rigorous procedure to derive the relative influence of kinetic effects on different phenomena in terms of the specific number of moments of the distribution function considered.},

abstract = {Collisionless electron-temperature-gradient-driven (ETG) turbulence in toroidal geometry is studied via nonlinear numerical simulations. To this aim, two massively parallel, fully gyrokinetic Vlasov codes are used, both including electromagnetic effects. Somewhat surprisingly, and unlike in the analogous case of ion-temperature-gradient-driven (ITG) turbulence, we find that the turbulent electron heat flux is significantly underpredicted by simple mixing length estimates in a certain parameter regime (ŝ∼1, low $\alpha$). This observation is directly linked to the presence of radially highly elongated vortices (“streamers”) which lead to very effective cross-field transport. The simulations therefore indicate that ETG turbulence is likely to be relevant to magnetic confinement fusion experiments.},

abstract = {Expressions for the neoclassical resistivity and the bootstrap current coefficients in terms of aspect ratio and collisionality are widely used in simulating toroidal axisymmetric equilibria and transport evolution. The formulas used are in most cases based on works done 15–20 years ago, where the results have been obtained for large aspect ratio, small or very large collisionality, or with a reduced collision operator. The best expressions to date and to our knowledge are due to Hirshman ?S. P. Hirshman, Phys. Fluids 31, 3150 ?1988?? for arbitrary aspect ratio in the banana regime and Hinton–Hazeltine ?F. L. Hinton and R. D. Hazeltine, Rev. Mod. Phys. 48, 239 ?1976?? for large aspect ratio and arbitrary collisionality regime. A code solving the Fokker–Planck equation with the full collision operator and including the variation along the magnetic field line, coupled with the adjoint function formalism, has been used to calculate these coefficients in arbitrary equilibrium and collisionality regimes. The coefficients have been obtained for a wide variety of plasma and equilibrium parameters and a comprehensive set of formulas, which have been fitted to the code results within 5{\%}, is proposed for evaluating the neoclassical conductivity and the bootstrap current coefficients. This extends previous works and also highlights inaccuracies in the previous formulas in this wide plasma parameter space.},

@article{Lauber2007,
abstract = {In a plasma with a population of super-thermal particles generated by heating or fusion processes, kinetic effects can lead to the additional destabilisation of MHD modes or even to additional energetic particle modes. In order to describe these modes, a new linear gyrokinetic MHD code has been developed and tested, LIGKA (linear gyrokinetic shear Alfv{\'{e}}n physics) [Ph. Lauber, Linear gyrokinetic description of fast particle effects on the MHD stability in tokamaks, Ph.D. Thesis, TU M{\"{u}}nchen, 2003; Ph. Lauber, S. G{\"{u}}nter, S.D. Pinches, Phys. Plasmas 12 (2005) 122501], based on a gyrokinetic model [H. Qin, Gyrokinetic theory and computational methods for electromagnetic perturbations in tokamaks, Ph.D. Thesis, Princeton University, 1998]. A finite Larmor radius expansion together with the construction of some fluid moments and specification to the shear Alfv{\'{e}}n regime results in a self-consistent, electromagnetic, non-perturbative model, that allows not only for growing or damped eigenvalues but also for a change in mode-structure of the magnetic perturbation due to the energetic particles and background kinetic effects. Compared to previous implementations [H. Qin, mentioned above], this model is coded in a more general and comprehensive way. LIGKA uses a Fourier decomposition in the poloidal coordinate and a finite element discretisation in the radial direction. Both analytical and numerical equilibria can be treated. Integration over the unperturbed particle orbits is performed with the drift-kinetic HAGIS code [S.D. Pinches, Ph.D. Thesis, The University of Nottingham, 1996; S.D. Pinches et al., CPC 111 (1998) 131] which accurately describes the particles' trajectories. This allows finite-banana-width effects to be implemented in a rigorous way since the linear formulation of the model allows the exchange of the unperturbed orbit integration and the discretisation of the perturbed potentials in the radial direction. Successful benchmarks for toroidal Alfv{\'{e}}n eigenmodes (TAEs) and kinetic Alfv{\'{e}}n waves (KAWs) with analytical results, ideal MHD codes, drift-kinetic codes and other codes based on kinetic models are reported. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The theory of plasma confinement by non-axisymmetric magnetic fields is reviewed. Such fields are used to confine fusion plasmas in stellarators, where in contrast to tokamaks and reversed-field pinches the magnetic field generally does not possess any continuous symmetry. The discussion is focussed on magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium conditions, collisionless particle orbits, and the kinetic theory of equilbrium and transport. Each of these topics is fundamentally affected by the absence of symmetry in the magnetic field: the field lines need not trace out nested flux surfaces, the particle orbits may not be confined, and the cross-field transport can be very large. Nevertheless, by tailoring the magnetic field appropriately, well-behaved equilibria with good confinement can be constructed, potentially offering an attractive route to magnetic fusion. In this article, the mathematical apparatus to describe stellarator plasmas is developed from first principles and basic elements underlying confinement optimization are introduced.},

In this paper, the tomographic algorithm and some preliminary results of the real-time plasma position control are presented with a performance benchmarking against other available positioning diagnostics.

Time-delay correlation analysis reveals that blobs form highly elongated filaments along the ambient magnetic field from the midplane to the divertor target. Those filaments appear to be fairly unaffected by the strong magnetic shear region close to the X-point with maximum correlation amplitudes of approximately 75{\%} between near-midplane and near-X-point fluctuations, as well as between near-midplane and divertor-target fluctuations. However, the filaments do not form at the same time everywhere within a flux tube, but appear, on average, first nearer the midplane and show diffusion along the magnetic field. This parallel propagation occurs on a time-scale that is much faster than expected from particle diffusion, but agrees with fundamental dispersion estimates.},

The first approach relies on known neoclassical coefficients in ideal MHD equilibria, using the Sauter[O. Sauter et al, Phys.

Using the ideal free-boundary magnetohydrodynamic code VMEC, we compute the flux-surface averaged bootstrap current density, with the Sauter and Shaing-Callen expressions for 2D and 3D ideal MHD equilibria including an edge pressure barrier with the application of resonant magnetic perturbations, and equilibria possessing a saturated non-resonant 1/1 internal kink mode with a weak internal pressure bar-rier. We compare the applicability of the self-consistent iterative model on the 3D applications and discuss the limitations and advantages of each bootstrap current model for each type of equilibrium.},

abstract = {The development of the continuum gyrokinetic code COGENT for edge plasma simulations is reported. The present version of the code models a nonlinear axisymmetric 4D (R, v(parallel to), mu) gyrokinetic equation coupled to the long-wavelength limit of the gyro-Poisson equation. Here, R is the particle gyrocenter coordinate in the poloidal plane, and v(parallel to) and mu are the guiding center velocity parallel to the magnetic field and the magnetic moment, respectively. The COGENT code utilizes a fourth-order finite-volume (conservative) discretization combined with arbitrary mapped multiblock grid technology (nearly field-aligned on blocks) to handle the complexity of tokamak divertor geometry with high accuracy. Topics presented are the implementation of increasingly detailed model collision operators, and the results of neoclassical transport simulations including the effects of a strong radial electric field characteristic of a tokamak pedestal under H-mode conditions.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, American Institute of Physics Inc. All rights reserved. This paper presents simulations of isolated 3D filaments in a slab geometry obtained using a newly developed 3D reduced fluid code, written using the BOUT++ framework. First, systematic scans were performed to investigate how the dynamics of a filament are affected by its amplitude, perpendicular size, and parallel extent. The perpendicular size of the filament was found to have a strong influence on its motions, as it determined the relative importance of parallel currents to polarization and viscous currents, whilst drift-wave instabilities were observed if the initial amplitude of the blob was increased sufficiently. Next, the 3D simulations were compared to 2D simulations using different parallel closures; namely, the sheath dissipation closure, which neglects parallel gradients, and the vorticity advection closure, which neglects the influence of parallel currents. The vorticity advection closure was found to not replicate the 3D perpendicular dynamics and overestimated the initial radial acceleration of all the filaments studied. In contrast, a more satisfactory comparison with the sheath dissipation closure was obtained, even in the presence of significant parallel gradients, where the closure is no longer valid. Specifically, it captured the contrasting dynamics of filaments with different perpendicular sizes that were observed in the 3D simulations which the vorticity advection closure failed to replicate. However, neither closure successfully replicated the Boltzmann spinning effects nor the associated poloidal drift of the blob that was observed in the 3D simulations. Although the sheath dissipation closure was concluded to be more successful in replicating the 3D dynamics, it is emphasized that the vorticity advection closure may still be relevant for situations where the parallel current is inhibited from closing through the sheath due to effects such as strong magnetic shear around X points or increased resistivity near the targets.},

abstract = {Microinstability driven turbulence in tokamaks is studied via numerical simulation of a comprehensive fluid model. For the ions, toroidal gyrofluid equations are derived which contain accurate models of the kinetic effects arising from toroidal grad B and curvature drifts, parallel Landau damping and its inverse, finite Larmor radius effects, and trapped ion effects. For the electrons, sophisticated bounce averaged trapped electron fluid equations are derived which model the toroidal precession resonance and use a Lorentz collision operator for pitch angle scattering. These coupled ion and electron equations can simultaneously describe the nonlinear evolution of toroidal ion temperature gradient driven instabilities and trapped electron modes, and provide realistic nonlinear calculations of ion and electron heat fluxes and particle fluxes. These equations are solved in a reduced flux tube geometry, formulated in general magnetic coordinates. This technique exploits the elongated nature of microinstability driven turbulence, which has long parallel scales and short perpendicular scales. The reduced simulation volume allows high resolution simulations in realistic tokamak geometry, fully retaining important toroidal effects such as good and bad curvature. These toroidal simulations predict much larger thermal transport than found in simplified sheared slab geometry, bringing the predictions up to experimentally measured levels. The turbulent fluctuation spectrum is peaked at long wavelengths compared to the fastest growing linear modes, and the fluctuation spectrum is anisotropic in k{\_}r and k{\_}theta, as seen in experimental fluctuation measurements. The nonlinear generation of sheared ExB flows is found to play an important role in the development and saturation of this turbulence, and the damping of these flows is carefully investigated. Finally, the predicted transport from these simulations is compared with experiment. The simulations underestimate the transport near the plasma edge, but encouraging agreement is found between the predicted and measured ion and electron heat transport in the core.},

Astrophysical flares, from the Earth's magnetosphere to $\gamma$-ray bursts and sawtooth crashes in laboratory plasmas, may all be powered by reconnection. Reconnection is essential for dynamos and the large-scale restructuring known as magnetic self-organization. We review reconnection theory and evidence for it. We emphasize recent developments in two-fluid physics, and the experiments, observations, and simulations that verify two-fluid effects. We discuss novel environments such as line-tied, relativistic, and partially ionized plasmas, focusing on mechanisms that make reconnection fast, as observed. Because there is evidence that fast reconnection in astrophysics requires small-scale structure, we briefly introduce how such structure might develop. Several areas merit attention for astrophysical applications: development of a kinetic model of reconnection to enable spectroscopic predictions, better understanding of the interplay between local and global scales, the role of collisionless reconnection in large systems, and the effects of flows, including turbulence.},

Time evolution is fully implicit, and 3rd-order WENO schemes are implemented. Benchmarks are presented for linear and non-linear problems (the Orszag-Tang vortex) showing good agreement. Performance of the code is tested by scaling with problem size and processor number, showing efficient scaling to thousands of processors. Linear initial-value simulations of ELMs using reduced ideal MHD are presented, and the results compared to the ELITE linear MHD eigenvalue code. The resulting mode-structures and growth-rate are found to be in good agreement (??BOUT++ = 0.245 ??A, ??ELITE = 0.239 ??A, with Alfv??nic timescale 1 / ??A = R / VA).

To this end, the global version of the 3D2V gyrokinetic code GENE, so far employing a $\delta$f-splitting technique, is extended to simulate electrostatic turbulence in straight open-field-line systems. The major extensions are the inclusion of the velocity-space nonlinearity, the development of a conducting-sheath boundary, and the implementation of the Lenard–Bernstein collision operator. With these developments, the code can be run as a full-f code and can handle particle loss to and reflection from the wall. The extended code is applied to modeling turbulence in the Large Plasma Device (LAPD), with a reduced mass ratio and a much lower collisionality.

abstract = {Nonlinear gyrokinetic equations are derived from a systematic Hamiltonian theory. The derivation employs Lie transforms and a noncanonical perturbation theory first used by Littlejohn for the simpler problem of asymptotically small gyroradius. For definiteness, only electrostatic fluctuations in slab geometry are considered; however, there is a straightforward generalization to arbitrary field geometry and electromagnetic perturbations. An energy invariant for the nonlinear system is derived, and several limiting forms are considered. The weak turbulence theory of the equations is examined. In particular, the wave kinetic equation of Galeev and Sagdeev can ony be derived by an asystematic truncation of the equations, implying that this equation fails to consider all gyrokinetic effects. The equations are simplified for the case of small but finite gyroradius and put in a form suitable for efficient computer simulation. Although it is possible to derive the Terry–Horton and Hasegawa–Mima equations as limiting cases of our theory, several new nonlinear terms absent from conventional theories appear and are discussed. The resulting theory is very similar in content to the recent work of Lee. However, the systematic nature of our derivation provides considerable insight into the structure and interpretation of the equations.},

@article{Qin2007,
abstract = {It turns out that gyrokinetic theory can be geometrically formulated as a special case of a geometrically generalized Vlasov-Maxwell system. It is proposed that the phase space of the space-time is a seven-dimensional fiber bundle P over the four-dimensional space-time M, and that a Poincare-Cartan-Einstein 1-form gamma on the seven-dimensional phase space determines a particle's worldline in the phase space. Through Liouville 6-form Omega and fiber integral, the 1-form gamma also uniquely defines a geometrically generalized Vlasov-Maxwell system as a field theory for the collective electromagnetic field. The geometric gyrokinetic theory is then developed as a special case of the geometrically generalized Vlasov-Maxwell system. In its most general form, gyrokinetic theory is about a symmetry, called gyrosymmetry, for magnetized plasmas, and the 1-form gamma again uniquely defines the gyrosymmetry. The objective is to decouple the gyrophase dynamics from the rest of the particle dynamics by finding the gyrosymmetry in gamma. Compared to other methods of deriving the gyrokinetic equations, the advantage of the geometric approach is that it allows any approximation based on mathematical simplification or physical intuition to be made at the 1-form level, and yet the field theories still have the desirable exact conservation properties, such as phase space volume conservation and energy-momentum conservation if the 1-form does not depend on the space-time coordinate explicitly. A set of generalized gyrokinetic equations valid for the edge plasmas is then derived using this geometric method. This formalism allows large-amplitude, time-dependent background electromagnetic fields to be developed fully nonlinearly in addition to small-amplitude, short-wavelength electromagnetic perturbations. The fact that we adopted the geometric method in the present study does not necessarily imply that the major results reported here cannot be achieved using classical methods. What the geometric method offers is a systematic treatment and simplified calculations. (C) 2007 American Institute of Physics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nrelativistic;geometric},

abstract = {Plasma is an ionized gas inwhich the collective behavior dominates over the individual particle interactions. For this reason, plasma is often treated as collisionless or collision-free. However, the discrete nature of the particles can be important, and often, the description of plasmas is incomplete without properly taking the discrete particle effects into account. The weak turbulence theory is a perturbative nonlinear theory, whose essential formalism was developed in the late 1950s and 1960s and continued on through the early 1980s. However, the standard material found in the literature does not treat the discrete particle effects and the associated fluctuations emitted spontaneously by thermal particles completely. Plasma particles emit electromagnetic fluctuations in all frequencies and wave vectors, but in the standard literature, the fluctuations are approximately treated by considering only those frequency-wave number regimes corresponding to the eigenmodes (or normal modes) satisfying the dispersion relations, while ignoring contributions from noneigenmodes. The present paper shows that the noneigenmode fluctuations modify the particle kinetic equation so that the generalized equation includes the Balescu-L´ enard-Landau collision integral and also modify the wave kinetic equation to include not only the collisional damping term but also a term that depicts the bremsstrahlung emission of plasma normal modes.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Physical Society. Collisional damping of electron plasma waves, the primary damping for high phase velocity waves, is proportional to the electron-ion collision rate, $\nu$ei,th. Here, it is shown that the damping rate normalized to $\nu$ei,th depends on the charge state, Z, on the magnitude of $\nu$ei,th and the wave number k in contrast with the commonly used damping rate in plasma wave research. Only for weak collision rates in low-Z plasmas for which the electron self-collision rate is comparable to the electron-ion collision rate is the damping rate given by the commonly accepted value. The result presented here corrects the result presented in textbooks at least as early as 1973. The complete linear theory requires the inclusion of both electron-ion pitch-angle and electron-electron scattering, which itself contains contributions to both pitch-angle scattering and thermalization.},

abstract = {We consider the linear axisymmetric stability of a differentially rotating collisionless plasma in the presence of a weak magnetic field; we restrict our analysis to wavelengths much larger than the proton Larmor radius. This is the kinetic version of the magnetorotational instability explored extensively as a mechanism for magnetic field amplification and angular momentum transport in accretion disks. The kinetic calculation is appropriate for hot accretion flows onto compact objects and for the growth of very weak magnetic fields, where the collisional mean free path is larger than the wavelength of the unstable modes. We show that the kinetic instability criterion is the same as in MHD, namely that the angular velocity decrease outward. However, nearly every mode has a linear kinetic growth rate that differs from its MHD counterpart. The kinetic growth rates also depend explicitly on beta, i.e., on the ratio of the gas pressure to the pressure of the seed magnetic field. For beta similar to 1 the kinetic growth rates are similar to the MHD growth rates, while for beta {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1 they differ significantly. For beta {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1, the fastest growing mode has a growth rate approximate to root3Omega for a Keplerian disk, larger than its MHD counterpart; there are also many modes whose growth rates are negligible, less than or similar tobeta(-1/2)Omega{\textless}{\textless}Omega. We provide a detailed physical interpretation of these results and show that gas pressure forces, rather than just magnetic forces, are central to the behavior of the magnetorotational instability in a collisionless plasma. We also discuss the astrophysical implications of our analysis.},

abstract = {The behaviour of the turbulence in magnetic fusion plasmas is discussed in the framework of dimensional analysis. Three main dimensionless parameters are identified, which directly affect the adiabatic response of the plasma and hence control the electron response. They were originally introduced by Scott ( 1997 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion [/0741-3335/39/10/010] 39 1635 ) and Rogers and Drake (1997 Phys. Rev. Lett. 79 229), and represent the effect of the electromagnetic induction, collisions and electron inertia. The dimensionless parameters are then evaluated at different radial positions in four existing divertor machines (ALCATOR C-MOD, ASDEX-Upgrade, JET and MAST) and in three future experiments (MAST-Upgrade, ITER and DEMO). Clear multi-machine trends, suggesting a quasi-universal behaviour of the plasma, are identified and discussed. Exploiting this quasi-universality, useful insight into the physics of the machines is obtained without complex calculations or expensive numerical simulations. In particular, the trends show a clear separation of the plasma in four distinct regions: core, edge, scrape-off layer and divertor, each of them characterized by a different set of parameters which, in turn, lead to significant variation of the dominant physical mechanisms across the machine.},

We demonstrate that the inclusion of collisional transport in drift-fluid models gives rise to diffusion of particle density, momentum and pressures in drift-fluid turbulence models and thereby obviate the customary use of artificial diffusion in turbulence simulations. We further derive a computationally efficient, two-dimensional model which can be time integrated for several turbulence de-correlation times using only limited computational resources. The model describes interchange turbulence in a two-dimensional plane perpendicular to the magnetic field located at the outboard midplane of a tokamak. The model domain has two regions modeling open and closed field lines. The model employs a computational expedient model for collisional transport. Numerical simulations show good agreement between the full and the simplified model for collisional transport.},

The possibility of extending an analogous closure to long mean-free path is examined here. An appropriate kinetic equation, using a model collision operator, is solved rigorously for arbitrary collisionality but weak, Maxwellian source terms. The corresponding particle and heat flows are then expressed in terms of the density and temperature profiles. The transport matrix is found to be symmetric even at vanishing collision frequency; in the collisionless limit it takes the form of nonlocal operators. The operator corresponding to thermal conductivity agrees with one found previously by other authors. However particle diffusion, which turns out to satisfy a local Fick's law for any finite collision frequency, becomes singular at vanishing collisionality, where the pressure gradient vanishes. It is concluded that the fluxes can generally be expressed in terms of particle and energy sources, but not always in terms of pressure and temperature profiles.},

Quantitative validation studies of flux-tube gyrokinetic Vlasov simulations on ion and electron heat transport are carried out for the JT-60U tokamak experiment.

Nonlinear turbulence simulations by the GKV code successfully reproduce radial profiles of the ion and electron energy fluxes in the core region. The numerical results show that the TEM-driven zonal flow generation in the outer region is more significant than that in the core region with ITG- and ITG-TEM-dominated turbulence, leading to moderate transport shortfall of the ion energy flux. Error levels in the prediction of the ion and electron temperature gradient profiles in the core region are estimated as less than ±30{\%}, based on a multiple flux matching technique, where the simulated ion and electron energy fluxes are simultaneously matched to the experimental values.},

abstract = {This paper reports on the theoretical and simulation results of a gyro-Landau-fluid extension of the BOUT++ code, which contributes to increasing the physics understanding of edge-localized-modes (ELMs). Large ELMs with low-to-intermediate-n peeling-ballooning (P-B) modes are significantly suppressed due to finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects when the ion temperature increases. For type-I ELMs, it is found from linear simulations that retaining complete first order FLR corrections as resulting from the incomplete "gyroviscous cancellation" in Braginskii's two-fluid model is necessary to obtain good agreement with gyro-fluid results for high ion temperature cases (Ti3 keV) when the ion density has a strong radial variation, which goes beyond the simple local model of ion diamagnetic stabilization of ideal ballooning modes. The maximum growth rate is inversely proportional to Ti because the FLR effect is proportional to Ti. The FLR effect is also proportional to toroidal mode number n, so for high n cases, the P-B mode is stabilized by FLR effects. Nonlinear gyro-fluid simulations show results that are similar to those from the two-fluid model, namely that the P-B modes trigger magnetic reconnection, which drives the collapse of the pedestal pressure. Due to the additional FLR-corrected nonlinear E × B convection of the ion gyro-center density, for a ballooning-dominated equilibrium the gyro-fluid model further limits the radial spreading of ELMs. In six-field two fluid simulations, the parallel thermal diffusivity is found to prevent the ELM encroachment further into core plasmas and therefore leads to steady state L-mode profiles. The simulation results show that most energy is lost via ion channel during an ELM event, followed by particle loss and electron energy loss. Because edge plasmas have significant spatial inhomogeneities and complicated boundary conditions, we have developed a fast non-Fourier method for the computation of Landau-fluid closure terms based on an accurate and tunable approximation. The accuracy and the fast computational scaling of the method have been demonstrated. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {The propagation of filaments in the Scrape Off Layer (SOL) of tokamaks largely determine the plasma profiles in the region. In a conduction limited SOL, parallel temperature gradients are expected, such that the resistance to parallel currents is greater at the target than further upstream. Since the perpendicular motion of an isolated filament is largely determined by balance of currents that flow through it, this may be expected to affect filament transport. 3D simulations have thus been used to study the influence of enhanced parallel resistivity on the dynamics of filaments. Filaments with the smallest perpendicular length scales, which were inertially limited at low resistivity (meaning that polarization rather than parallel currents determine their radial velocities), were unaffected by resistivity. For larger filaments, faster velocities were produced at higher resistivities, due to two mechanisms. Firstly parallel currents were reduced and polarization currents were enhanced, meaning that the inertial regime extended to larger filaments, and secondly a potential difference formed along the parallel direction so that higher potentials were produced in the region of the filament for the same amount of current to flow into the sheath. These results indicate that broader SOL profiles could be produced at higher resistivities.},

abstract = {The excitation of stable eigenmodes in unstable plasma turbulence, previously documented in collisionless trapped electron mode turbulence, is shown to be a generic behavior of local ͑quasihomogeneous͒ systems. A condition is derived to indicate when such excited eigenmodes achieve a sufficient level in saturation to affect the turbulence, and produce changes in saturation levels, instability drive, and transport. The condition is shown to be consistent with the results of collisionless and dissipative trapped electron turbulence, and is further illustrated by an entirely different model describing simple ion turbulence driven by the ion temperature gradient. The condition suggests that all eigenmodes of the ion model affect saturation, but none dominates. This is consistent with the results of simulations, which show nonlinear modifications to eigenmode structure, growth rate, and transport that occur intermittently in time, despite fixed driving gradients.},

The TGLF particle and energy fluxes have been successfully verified against a large database of collisionless nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations using the GYRO code. Using a new collision model in TGLF, we find remarkable agreement between the TGLF quasilinear fluxes and 64 new GYRO nonlinear simulations with electron–ion collisions. In validating TGLF against DIII-D and JET H-mode and hybrid discharges we find the temperature and density profiles are in excellent agreement with the measured profiles. ITER projections using TGLF show that the fusion gains are somewhat more pessimistic than the previous GLF23 results primarily due to finite aspect ratio effects included only in TGLF. The synergistic effects of density peaking, finite $\beta$ and E × B shear due to finite toroidal rotation lead to significant increases in fusion power above a reduced physics ITER base case. The TGLF results for ITER are confirmed using nonlinear GYRO simulations in place of TGLF to predict the temperature profiles within the TGYRO transport code. These results represent a snapshot of the ongoing effort to improve the TGLF model, validate it against experimental data, and make predictions for ITER.},

abstract = {We present the design and implementation of an L2-stable spectral method for the discretization of the Vlasov-Poisson model of a collisionless plasma in one space and velocity dimension. The velocity and space dependence of the Vlasov equation are resolved through a truncated spectral expansion based on Legendre and Fourier basis functions, respectively. The Poisson equation, which is coupled to the Vlasov equation, is also resolved through a Fourier expansion. The resulting system of ordinary differential equation is discretized by the implicit second-order accurate Crank-Nicolson time discretization. The non-linear dependence between the Vlasov and Poisson equations is iteratively solved at any time cycle by a Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov method. In this work we analyze the structure of the main conservation laws of the resulting Legendre-Fourier model, e.g., mass, momentum, and energy, and prove that they are exactly satisfied in the semi-discrete and discrete setting. The L2-stability of the method is ensured by discretizing the boundary conditions of the distribution function at the boundaries of the velocity domain by a suitable penalty term. The impact of the penalty term on the conservation properties is investigated theoretically and numerically. An implementation of the penalty term that does not affect the conservation of mass, momentum and energy, is also proposed and studied. A collisional term is introduced in the discrete model to control the filamentation effect, but does not affect the conservation properties of the system. Numerical results on a set of standard test problems illustrate the performance of the method.},

Quantitative agreement between the flux-driven simulation and the experimental electron density, impurity density, and orthogonal measurements of impurity temperature and flow profiles is achieved by adding random-walk particle diffusion to the guiding-center drift motion. The radial electric field (Er) that maintains ambipolar transport across flux surfaces and to the wall is computed self-consistently on closed and open magnetic field lines and is in excellent agreement with experiment. The Er inside the separatrix is the unique solution that balances the outward flux of thermal tail deuterium ions against the outward neoclassical electron flux and inward pinch of impurity and colder deuterium ions. Particle transport in the pedestal is primarily due to anomalous transport, while the ion heat and momentum transport are primarily due to the neoclassical transport. The full-f treatment quantifies the non-Maxwellian energy distributions that describe a number of experimental observations in low-collisionallity pedestals on DIII-D, including intrinsic co-Ip parallel flows in the pedestal, ion temperature anisotropy, and large impurity temperatures in the scrape-off layer.},

abstract = {The basic scales of motion and computational requirements for low frequency fluid drift turbulence are summarized in tutorial fashion, with emphasis on the tokamak edge region. Parameters are given by experimental observations, but the computations are otherwise done from. rst principles. Edge turbulence is fundamentally electromagnetic and nonlinear, not treatable by standard linear or secondary instability analysis. Energetic character is determined by diagnosis of the terms in the energy theorem within the fully developed saturated phase. The spectra of the fluctuations and transport always extend to below the ion gyroradius scale. Direct coupling of pressure fluctuations and E-cross-B eddies through the parallel current is always active. Edge turbulence derives its character from steep gradients, with a parallel/perp scale ratio larger than 100, rather than from collisional effects. Collisionality is neither absent nor strongly dominant for electrons, but very weak for ions. Fluctuations in the axisymmetric component, including the Pfirsch-Schluter currents, are dynamically integrated into the turbulence. Time scales are one to two orders of magnitude shorter than the ion collision time, hence significant delays occur in the response of heat fluxes and viscosity to temperature gradients and flows. Hence the need for a trans-collisional gyrofluid model to treat cases with comparable ion and electron temperature. Two orders of magnitude in spatial scales and three in time scales are typically involved.},

abstract = {In this paper we review some theoretical aspects of the dynamics of the mesoscale filaments extending along the magnetic field lines in the edge plasma, which are often called ‘blobs'. We start with a brief historical survey of experi- mental data and the main ideas on edge and SOL plasma transport, which finally evolved into the modern paradigm of convective very-intermittent cross-field edge plasma transport. We show that both extensive analytic treatments and numer- ical simulations demonstrate that plasma blobs with enhanced pressure can be convected coherently towards the wall. The mechanism of convection is related to an effective gravity force (e.g. owing to magnetic curvature effects), which causes plasma polarization and a corresponding E×B convection. The impacts of different effects (e.g. X-point magnetic geometry, plasma collisionality, plasma beta, etc.) on blob dynamics are considered. Theory and simulation predict, both for current tokamaks and for ITER, blob propagation speeds and cross-field sizes to be of the order of a few hundred meters per second and a centimeter, respectively, which are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data. Moreover, the concept of blobs as a fundamental entity of convective transport in the scrape-off layer provides explanations for observed outwards convective transport, intermittency and non-Gaussian statistics in edge plasmas, and enhanced wall recycling in both toroidal and linear machines.},

abstract = {An electron density gradient driven instability identified as the toroidal branch of the universal drift instability is studied using a global gyrokinetic model treating both electrons and ions fully nonadiabatically and valid at all orders in the ratio of the Larmor radius to the wavelength. The physics of the magnetic drift resonance, Landau resonance and transit resonance, which are considered to be important for the toroidal universal mode, are kept for both species. A systematic parametric study is carried out for the mode. The toroidal universal drift mode is observed to sustain finite temperature gradient and can thus coexist with the temperature gradient driven modes and may contribute to the observed particle transport along with other drift modes. Especially at intermediate scales between the ion temperature gradient driven mode and electron temperature gradient driven mode, this branch of the drift instability can also be a plausible candidate for the observed particle loss.

abstract = {Drift waves occur universally in magnetized plasmas producing the dominant mechanism for the transport of particles, energy and momentum across magnetic field lines. A wealth of information obtained from quasistationary laboratory experiments for plasma confinement is reviewed for drift waves driven unstable by density gradients, temperature gradients and trapped particle effects. The modern understanding of Bohm transport and the role of sheared flows and magnetic shear in reducing the transport to the gyro-Bohm rate are explained and illustrated with large scale computer simulations. The types of mixed wave and vortex turbulence spontaneously generated in nonuniform plasmas are derived with reduced magnetized fluid descriptions. The types of theoretical descriptions reviewed include weak turbulence theory, Kolmogorov anisotropic spectral indices, and the mixing length. A number of standard turbulent diffusivity formulas are given for the various space-time scales of the drift-wave turbulent mixing.},

abstract = {The time evolution of the ring current population during the recovery phase of a typical moderate magnetic storm is studied, using a newly developed kinetic model for H+, He+ and O+ ions which includes nonequatorially mirroring particles. The bounce-averaged distribution function is defined for variables that are accessible to direct measurement, and some useful formulas for calculating the total energy and number density of the ring current are derived. The bounce-averaged kinetic equation is solved, including losses due to charge exchange with neutral hydrogen and Coulomb collisions with thermal plasma along ion drift paths. Time-dependent magnetospheric electric fields and anisotropic initial pitch angle distributions are considered. The generation of ion precipitating fluxes is addressed, a process that is still not completely understood. It is shown that both the decrease of the distribution function due to charge exchange losses and the buildup of a low-energy population caused by Coulomb collisions proceed faster for particles with smaller pitch angles. The maximum of the equatorial precipitating fluxes occurs on the nightside during the early recovery phase and is found to be of the order of 104–105 cm−2sr−1s−1keV−1. The mechanisms considered in this paper indicate that magnetospheric convection plays the predominant role in causing ion precipitation; Coulomb scattering contributes significantly to the low-energy ion precipitation inside the plasmasphere.},

The flattening of the SOL density profiles is linked to a regime change of filaments, which become faster and larger, and to a similar flattening of the q ∥ profile. This transition is related to the beginning of outer divertor detachment and leads to the onset of a velocity shear layer in the SOL. Experimental measurements are in good agreement with several filament models which describe the process as a transition from conduction to convection-dominated SOL perpendicular transport caused by an increase of parallel collisionality. These results could be of great relevance since both ITER and DEMO will feature detached divertors and densities largely over the transition values, and might therefore exhibit convective transport levels different to those observed typically in present-day devices.},

Although metamaterials are surely not the answer to all engineering problems, they have inspired a series of significant technological developments and also some imaginative research, because they invite researchers and inventors to dream. Imagine there were no practical limits on the electromagnetic properties of materials. What is possible? And what is not? If there are no practical limits, what are the fundamental limits? Such questions inspire taking a fresh look at the foundations of optics and at connections between optics and other areas of physics. In this article we discuss such a connection, the relationship between optics and general relativity, or, expressed more precisely, between geometrical ideas normally applied in general relativity and the propagation of light, or electromagnetic waves in general, in materials. We also discuss how this connection is applied: in invisibility devices, perfect lenses, the optical Aharonov-Bohm effect of vortices and in analogues of the event horizon.},

abstract = {A linearised kinetic equation describing electrostatic perturbations of a Maxwellian equilibrium in a weakly collisional plasma forced by a random source is considered. The problem is treated as a kinetic analogue of the Langevin equation and the corresponding fluctuation-dissipation relations are derived. The kinetic fluctuation-dissipation relation reduces to the standard “fluid” one in the regime where the Landau damping rate is small and the system has no real frequency; in this case the simplest possible Landau-fluid closure of the kinetic equation coincides with the standard Langevin equation. Phase mixing of density fluctuations and emergence of fine scales in velocity space is diagnosed as a constant flux of free energy in Hermite space; the fluctuation-dissipation relations for the perturbations of the distribution function are derived, in the form of a universal expression for the Hermite spectrum of the free energy. Finite-collisionality effects are included. This work is aimed at establishing the simplest fluctuation-dissipation relations for a kinetic plasma, clarifying the connection between Landau and Hermite-space formalisms, and setting a benchmark case for a study of phase mixing in turbulent plasmas.},

This is because of the spatiotemporal dynamics of transport phenomena (magnetic flux, heat, densities, etc.) in the anisotropic plasma medium. Robustness considerations are ubiquitous in the analysis and control design since direct measurements on the magnetic flux are impossible (its estimation relies on virtual sensors) and large uncertainties remain in the coupling between the plasma particles and the radio-frequency waves (distributed inputs).$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe Brief begins with a presentation of the reference dynamical model and continues by developing a Lyapunov function for the discretized system (in a polytopic linear-parameter-varying formulation). The limitations of this finite-dimensional approach motivate new developments in the infinite-dimensional framework. The text then tackles the construction of an input-to-state-stabilityLyapunov function for the infinite-dimensional system that handles the medium anisotropy and provides a common basis for analytical robustness results. This function is used as a control-Lyapunov function and allows the amplitude and nonlinear shape constraints in the control action to be dealt with. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nFinally, the Brief addresses important application- and implementation-specific concerns. In particular, the coupling of the PDE and the finite-dimensional subsystem representing the evolution of the boundary condition (magnetic coils) and the introduction of profile-reconstruction delays in the control loop (induced by solving a 2-D inverse problem for computing the magnetic flux) is analyzed. Simulation results are presented for various operation scenarios on Tore Supra (simulated with METIS) and on TCV (simulated with RAPTOR). $\backslash$n$\backslash$nControl of the Safety Factor Profile in a Tokamak will be of interest to both academic and industrially-based researchers interested in nuclear energy and plasma-containment control systems, and graduate students in nuclear and control engineering.},

As a result, Landau damping of the plasma wave vanishes and the resonant frequency of the plasma wave downshifts. However, this simple picture is invalid when the external driving force changes the plasma wave fast enough so that the plateau cannot be fully developed. A new model to describe amplification of the plasma wave including the saturation of Landau damping and the nonlinear frequency shift is proposed. The proposed model takes into account the change of the plasma wave amplitude and describes saturation of the Landau damping rate in terms of a single fluid equation, which simplifies the description of the inherently kinetic nature of Landau damping. A proposed fluid model, incorporating these simplifications, is verified numerically using a kinetic Vlasov code.},
